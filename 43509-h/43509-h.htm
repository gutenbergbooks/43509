<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p class="noi"><i>Dear Boys</i>:</p>

<p>Here it is at last&mdash;the fourth volume of “The
Motor Boys Series,” for which so many boys all
over our land have been asking during the past
year.</p>

<p>To those who have read the other volumes in
this line, this new tale needs no special introduction.
To others, I would say that in the first volume, entitled,
“The Motor Boys,” I introduced three wide-awake
American lads, Ned, Bob and Jerry, and
told how they first won a bicycle race and then
a great motor cycle contest,&mdash;the prize in the latter
being a big touring car.</p>

<p>Having obtained the automobile, the lads went
west, and in the second volume, called, “The
Motor Boys Overland,” were related the particulars
of a struggle for a valuable mine, a struggle
which tested the boys’ bravery to the utmost.</p>

<p>While in the west the boys heard of a strange
buried city in Mexico, and, in company with a
learned college professor, journeyed to that locality.
The marvellous adventures met with are
told in “The Motor Boys in Mexico.”</p>

<p>Leaving the buried city, the boys started again
for the locality of the mine, and in the present tale
are told the particulars of some strange things that
happened on the way. A portion of this story is
based on facts, related to me while on an automobiling
tour in the west, by an old ranchman who
had participated in some of the occurrences.</p>

<p>With best wishes, and hoping we shall meet
again, I leave you to peruse the pages which follow.</p>

<h1>THE MOTOR BOYS ACROSS
THE PLAINS</h1>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a><br />
<small>RAMMING AN OX CART</small></h2>


<p>Mingled with the frantic tooting of an automobile
horn, there was the shrill shrieking of the
brake-band as it gripped the wheel hub in a friction
clutch.</p>

<p>“Hi, Bob! Look out for that ox cart ahead!”
exclaimed one of three sturdy youths in the touring
car.</p>

<p>“I should say so! Jam on the brakes, Bob!”
put in the tallest of the trio, while an elderly man,
who was in the rear seat with one of the boys,
glanced carelessly up to see what was the trouble.</p>

<p>“I have got the brake on, Jerry!” was the
answer the lad at the steering wheel made.
“Can’t you and Ned hear it screeching!”</p>

<p>The auto was speeding down a steep hill, seemingly
headed straight toward a solitary Mexican<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
who was moving slowly along in an antiquated ox-drawn
vehicle.</p>

<p>“Then why don’t she slow up? You’ve got
the power off, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“Of course! Do you take me for an idiot!”
yelled Bob, or, as his friends sometimes called him,
because of his fatness, “Chunky.” “Of course
I’ve shut down, but something seems to be the
matter with the brake pedal.”</p>

<p>“Have you tried the emergency?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Sure!”</p>

<p><em>Toot! Toot! Toot!</em></p>

<p>Again the horn honked out a warning to the
Mexican, but he did not seem to hear.</p>

<p>The big red touring car was gathering speed, in
spite of the fact that it was not under power, and
it bore down ever closer to the ox cart.</p>

<p>“Cut out the muffler and let him hear the explosions,”
suggested Jerry.</p>

<p>Bob did so, and the sounds that resulted were
not unlike a Gatling gun battery going into action.
This time the native heard.</p>

<p>Glancing back, he gave a frightened whoop and
jabbed the sharp goad into the ox. The animal
turned squarely across the road, thus shutting off
what small chance there might have been of the
auto gliding past on either side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’re going to hit him sure!” yelled Ned.
“I say Professor, you’d better hold on to your
specimens. There’s going to be all sorts of things
doing in about two shakes of a rattlesnake’s tail!”</p>

<p>“What’s that about a rattlesnake?” asked the
old man, who, looking up from a box of bugs and
stones on his lap, seemed aware, for the first time,
of the danger that threatened.</p>

<p>“Hi there! Get out of the way! Move the
cart! Shake a leg! Pull to one side and let us
have half the road!” yelled Jerry as a last desperate
resort, standing up and shouting at the bewildered
and frightened Mexican.</p>

<p>“Oh pshaw! He don’t understand United
States!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“That’s so,” admitted Jerry ruefully.</p>

<p>“Vamoose, is the proper word for telling a
Mexican to get out of the road,” suggested the
professor calmly. “Perhaps if you shouted that
at him he might&mdash;”</p>

<p>What effect trying the right word might have
had the boys had no chance of learning, for, the
next instant, in spite of Bob’s frantic working at
the brake, the auto shot right at the ox cart. By
the merest good luck, more than anything else,
for Bob could steer neither to the right nor left,
because the narrow road was hemmed in by high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
banks, the machine struck the smaller vehicle a
glancing blow.</p>

<p>The force of the impact skidded the auto on
two wheels up the side of the embankment, where,
poking the front axle into a stump served to bring
the car to a stop. The car was slewed around to
one side, the ox was yanked from its feet, and,
as the cart overturned, the Mexican, yelling
voluble Spanish, pitched out into the road.</p>

<p>Nor did the boys and the professor come off
scathless, for the sudden stopping of their machine
piled the occupants on the rear seat up in a heap
on the floor of the tonneau, while Bob and Jerry,
who were in front, went sprawling into the dust
near the native.</p>

<p>For a few seconds there was no sound save the
yelling of the Mexican and the bellowing of the
ox. Then the cloud of dust slowly drifted away,
and Bob picked himself up, gazing ruefully about.</p>

<p>“This is a pretty kettle of fish,” he remarked.</p>

<p>“I should say it was several of ’em,” agreed
Jerry, trying to get some of the dust from his
mouth, ears and nose. “You certainly hit him,
Chunky!”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t my fault! How did I know the
brake wasn’t going to work just the time it was
most needed?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is anybody killed?” asked the professor, looking
up over the edge of the tonneau, and not releasing
his hold of several boxes which contained
his specimens.</p>

<p>“Don’t seem to be, nor any one badly hurt,
unless it’s the ox or the auto,” said Ned, taking
a look. “The Mexican seems to be mad about
something, though.”</p>

<p>By this time the native had arisen from his
prostrate position and was shaking his fist at the
Motor Boys and the professor, meanwhile, it would
appear from his language, calling them all the
names to which he could lay his tongue.</p>

<p>“I guess he wants Bob’s scalp,” said Jerry with
a smile.</p>

<p>“It was as much his fault as mine,” growled
Chunky. “If he had pulled to one side, I could
easily have passed.”</p>

<p>The Mexican, brushing the dust from his
clothes, approached the auto party, and continued
his rapid talk in Spanish. The boys, who had
been long enough in Mexico to pick up considerable
of the language, gathered that the native demanded
two hundred dollars for the damage to himself, the
cart and the ox, as well as for the injury to his
dignity and feelings.</p>

<p>“You’d better talk to him, Professor,” suggested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Jerry. “Offer him what you think is
right.”</p>

<p>Thereupon Professor Snodgrass, in mild terms
explained how the accident had happened, saying
it was no fault of the auto party.</p>

<p>The Mexican, in language more forcible than
polite, reiterated his demand, and announced that
unless the money was instantly forthcoming, he
would go to the nearest alcade and lodge a complaint.</p>

<p>The travelers knew what this meant, with the
endless delays of Mexican justice, the summoning
of witnesses and petty officers.</p>

<p>“I wish there was some way out,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>As the Mexican had not been hurt, nor his cart
or ox been damaged, there was really no excuse for
the boys giving in to his demands.</p>

<p>“Let’s give him a few dollars and skip out,”
suggested Ned. “He can’t catch us.”</p>

<p>This was easier said than done, for the auto was
jammed up against a tree stump on a bank, and
the ox cart, which, the native by this time had
righted, blocked the road.</p>

<p>But, all unexpectedly, there came a diversion that
ended matters. Professor Snodgrass, with his
usual care for his beloved specimens before himself,
was examining the various boxes containing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
them. He opened one containing his latest acquisition
of horned toads, big lizards, rattlesnakes and
bats. The reptiles crawled, jumped and flew out,
for they were all alive.</p>

<p>“Diabalo! Santa Maria! Carramba!” exclaimed
the Mexican as he caught sight of the repulsive
creatures. “They are crazy Americanos!”
he yelled.</p>

<p>With a flying leap he jumped into his ox cart,
and with goad and voice he urged the animal on
to such advantage that, a few minutes later, all
that was to be seen of him was a cloud of dust in
the distance.</p>

<p>“Good riddance,” said Bob. “Now to see
how much our machine is damaged.”</p>

<p>Fortunately the auto had struck a rotten stump,
and though with considerable force, the impact
was not enough to cause any serious damage. Under
the direction of Jerry the boys managed to get
the machine back into the road, where they let it
stand while they went to a near-by spring for a
drink of water.</p>

<p>While they are quenching their thirst an opportunity
will be taken to present them to the reader
in proper form.</p>

<p>The three boys were Bob Baker, son of Andrew
Baker, a banker, Ned Slade, the only heir of Aaron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Slade, a department store proprietor, and Jerry
Hopkins, the son of a widow. All three were
about seventeen years of age, and lived in the city
of Cresville, not far from Boston, Mass. Their
companion was Professor Uriah Snodgrass, a
learned man with many letters after his name,
signifying the societies and institutions to which he
belonged.</p>

<p>Those who have read the first book of this series,
entitled, “The Motor Boys,” need no introduction
to the three lads. Sufficient to say that some time
before this story opens they had taken part in some
exciting bicycle races, the winning of which resulted
in the acquiring of motor cycles for each of
them.</p>

<p>On these machines they had had much fun and
had also many adventures befall them. Taking
part in a big race meet, one of them won an event
which gave him a chance to get a big touring automobile,
the same car in which they were now
speeding through Mexico.</p>

<p>Their adventures in the auto are set forth at
length in the second volume of the series entitled,
“The Motor Boys Overland,” which tells of a
tour across the country, in which they had to contend
with their old enemy, Noddy Nixon, and his
gang. Eventually the boys and Jim Nestor, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
miner whom they befriended, gained some information
of a long lost gold mine in Arizona.</p>

<p>They made a dash for this and won it against
heavy odds, after a fight with their enemies. The
mine turned out well, and the boys and their friends
made considerable money.</p>

<p>The spirit of adventure would not drown in
them. Just before reaching the diggings they
made the acquaintance of Professor Snodgrass,
who told a wonderful story of a buried city. How
the boys found this ancient town of old Mexico,
and the many adventures that befell them there,
are told in the third book, called “The Motor
Boys in Mexico.”</p>

<p>Therein is related the strange happenings under
ground, of the sunken road, the old temples, the
rich treasures and the fights with the bandits. Also
there is told of the rescue of the Mexican girl
Maximina, and how she was taken from a band of
criminals and restored to her friends.</p>

<p>These happenings brought the boys and the professor
to the City of Mexico, where the auto was
given a good overhauling, to prepare it for the
trip back to the United States.</p>

<p>The boys and the professor, the latter bearing
with him his beloved specimens, started back for
civilization, keeping to the best and most frequented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
roads, to avoid the brigands, with whom
they had had more than one adventure on their
first trip. It was while on this homeward journey
that the incident of the Mexican and the ox cart
befell them.</p>

<p>Having slaked their thirst the boys and the professor
went back to the auto where, gathering up
the belongings that had become scattered from
the upset, they prepared to resume their journey.</p>

<p>“Get in; I’ll run her for a while,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“One minute! Stand still! Don’t move if you
value my happiness!” exclaimed the professor suddenly,
dropping down on his hands and knees, and
creeping forward through the long grass.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />
<small>A NEST OF SERPENTS</small></h2>


<p>“What is it; a rattlesnake?” asked Bob, in a
hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>“Or a Gila monster?” inquired Ned.</p>

<p>“Quiet! No noise!” cautioned the professor.
“I see a specimen worth ten dollars at the lowest
calculation. I’ll have him in a minute.”</p>

<p>“Is it a bug?” asked Chunky.</p>

<p>“There! I have him!” yelled the scientist,
making a sudden dive forward, sliding on his face,
and clutching his hand deep into the grass.</p>

<p>As it happened there was a little puddle of water
at that point, and the professor, in the excess of
his zeal, pitched right into it.</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh my! Oh dear! Phew! Wow!
Help! Save me!” he exclaimed a moment later,
as he tried to get out of the slough.</p>

<p>The boys hurried to his aid, but the mud was
soft and the professor had gone head first into the
ooze, which held fast to him as though it was
quicksand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>“Get him by the heels and yank him out or he’ll
smother!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>The other boys followed his advice, and, in a
little while the bug-collector was pulled from his
uncomfortable and dangerous position. As he
rolled about in the grass to get rid of some of the
mud, he kept his right hand tightly closed.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, are your fingers hurt?”
asked Bob.</p>

<p>“No sir, my fingers are not hurt!” snapped the
professor, with the faintest tinge of impatience,
which might be excused on the part of a man who
has just dived into a mud hole. “My fingers are
not hurt in the least. What I have here is one
of the rarest specimens of the Mexican mosquito
I have ever seen. I would go ten miles to get
one.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’re welcome to ’em,” commented
Jerry. “We don’t want any.”</p>

<p>“That’s because you don’t understand the value
of this specimen,” replied the professor. “This
mosquito will add to my fame, and I shall devote
one whole chapter of my four books to it. This
indeed has been a lucky day for me.”</p>

<p>“And unlucky for the rest of us,” said Bob, as
he thought of the spill.</p>

<p>It was found that a few minor repairs had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
be made to the auto, and when these were completed
it was nearly noon.</p>

<p>“I vote we have dinner before we start again,”
spoke Bob.</p>

<p>“There goes Chunky!” exclaimed Ned.
“Never saw him when he wasn’t thinking of something
to eat!”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess if the truth was known you
are just as hungry as I am,” expostulated
Chunky. “This Mexican air gives me a good
appetite.”</p>

<p>Bob’s plan was voted a good one, so, with supplies
and materials carried in the auto for camping
purposes, a fire was soon built, and hot chocolate
was being made.</p>

<p>“I’m sick of canned stuff and those endless eggs,
frijoles and tortillas,” complained Bob. “I’d like
a good beefsteak and some fish and bread and butter.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about the other things, but I think
we could get some fish over in that little brook,”
said the professor, pointing to a stream that wound
about the base of a near-by hill.</p>

<p>A minute later the boys had their hooks and
lines out. Poles were cut from trees, and, with
some pieces of canned meat for bait they went fishing.
They caught several large white fish, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the professor named in long Latin terms, and
which, he said, were good to eat.</p>

<p>In a little while a savory smell filled the air,
for Ned, who volunteered to act as cook, had put
the fish on to broil with some strips of bacon, and
soon there was a dinner fit for any king that ever
wielded a scepter.</p>

<p>Sipping their chocolate, the boys and the professor
watched the sun slowly cross the zenith as
they reclined in the shade of the big trees on either
side of the road. Then each one half fell asleep
in the lazy atmosphere.</p>

<p>Jerry was the first to rouse up. He looked and
saw it would soon be dusk, and then he awakened
the others.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to travel, unless we want to sleep
out in the open,” he said.</p>

<p>Thereupon they made preparations to leave, the
professor gathering up his specimens, including the
Mexican mosquito that had caused him such labor.</p>

<p>“I think we’ll head straight for the Rio
Grande,” said Jerry. “Once we get into Texas
I expect we’ll have some news from Nestor, as
I wrote him to let us know how the mine was getting
on, and, also, to inform us if he needed any
help.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be glad to see old Jim again,” said Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>“So will I,” chimed in Ned.</p>

<p>The auto was soon chug-chugging over the road,
headed toward the States, and the occupants were
engaged with their thoughts. It was rapidly
growing dusk, and the chief anxiety was to reach
some town or village where they could spend the
night. For, though they were used to staying in
the open, they did not care to, now that the rainy
season was coming on, when fevers were prevalent.</p>

<p>The sun sank slowly to rest behind the big
wooded hills as the auto glided along, and, almost
before the boys realized it, darkness was upon
them.</p>

<p>“Better light the lamps,” suggested Ned.
“No telling what we’ll run into on this road. No
use colliding with more ox carts, if we can help it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll light up,” volunteered Bob. “It will give
me a chance to stretch my legs. I’m all cramped
up from sitting still so long.”</p>

<p>Jerry brought the big machine to a stop while
Bob alighted and proceeded to illuminate the big
search lamp and the smaller ones that burned oil.
He had just started the acetylene gas aglow when,
glancing forward he gave a cry of alarm.</p>

<p>“What is it?” cried Jerry, seeing that something
was wrong. “Is it a mountain lion?”</p>

<p>“It’s worse!” cried Bob in a frightened voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“A regular den of snakes! The horrible things
are stretched right across the road, and we can’t
get past. Ugh! There are some whoppers!”</p>

<p>Bob, who hated, above all creatures a snake,
made a jump into the auto.</p>

<p>“There’s about a thousand of ’em!” he cried
with a shudder.</p>

<p>“Great!” exclaimed the professor. “I will
have a chance to select some fine specimens. This
is a rare fortune!”</p>

<p>“Don’t go out there!” gasped Bob. “You’ll
be bitten to death!”</p>

<p>Just then there sounded on the stillness of the
night a strange, whirring buzz. At the sound of it
the professor started.</p>

<p>“Rattlers!” he whispered. “I guess none of
us will get out. Probably moccasins, cotton-mouths
and vipers! There must be thousands of
them!”</p>

<p>As he spoke he looked over the side of the car,
and the exclamation he gave caused the boys to
glance toward the ground. There they beheld a
sight that filled them with terror.</p>

<p>As the professor had said, the ground was literally
covered with the snakes. The reptiles seemed
to be moving in a vast body to some new location.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
There were big snakes and little ones, round fat
ones, and long thin ones, and of many hues.</p>

<p>“Let’s get out of this!” exclaimed Ned.
“Start the machine, Jerry!”</p>

<p>“No! Don’t!” called the professor. “You
may kill a few, but the revolving wheels of the
auto will fling some live ones up among us, and
I have no desire to be bitten by any of these
reptiles. They are too deadly. So keep the car
still until they have passed. They are probably
getting ready to go into winter quarters, or whatever
corresponds to that in Mexico.”</p>

<p>“It will be lucky if they don’t take a notion
to climb up and investigate the machine and us,”
put in Jerry. “I have&mdash;”</p>

<p>He gave a sudden start, for, at that instant one
of the ugly reptiles, which had twined itself around
the wheel spokes, reared its ugly head up, over the
side of the front seat, and hissed, right in Jerry’s
face.</p>

<p>“Here’s one now!” the boy exclaimed as he
made a motion to brush the snake aside.</p>

<p>“Don’t touch it as you value your life!” yelled
the professor. “It’s a diamond-backed rattler,
and one of the most deadly!”</p>

<p>“Here is another coming up on my side,” called
Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, and there are some coming up here!”
shouted Ned. “They’ll overwhelm us if we don’t
look out!”</p>

<p>For a time it seemed a serious matter. The
snakes began twining up the sides of the car, and,
though most of them dropped back to the ground
again, a few maintained their position, and seemed
to exhibit anger at the sight of the boys and the
professor.</p>

<p>“What shall we do?” asked Bob. “We can’t
run ahead, or go backward, and, if we stay here
we’re likely to be killed by the snakes.”</p>

<p>Jerry, who was feeling around in the bottom
of the car for his rifle, gave a cry as his hand came
in contact with something.</p>

<p>“Get bitten?” asked the professor in alarm.</p>

<p>“No, but I found this lariat,” said Jerry in excited
tones.</p>

<p>“Are you going to lasso the snakes?” asked
Ned, wondering if Jerry had gone crazy.</p>

<p>“No, but you see this lariat is made of horse
hair, and I think I can keep the snakes away with
it.”</p>

<p>“How; by shaking it at ’em?”</p>

<p>“No. I read in some book that snakes hated
horse hair, and would never cross even a small
ring of it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Well, if I run this lariat all around the auto
the snakes will not cross it to come to us. Then
we can stay here until they all disappear.”</p>

<p>“Good!” exclaimed Ned. “That’s the
ticket!”</p>

<p>The reptiles that had climbed up the wheels had
gone from sight. With the help of Ned and Bob,
Jerry began to spread the horse-hair lariat in a
circle about the car.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />
<small>THE DESERTED CABIN</small></h2>


<p>In a few minutes the hair rope was all about
the auto, spread out on the ground in an irregular
circle. As the boys dropped it over the sides of
the car the lariat struck several of the big snakes,
and the reptiles shrunk away as though scorched
by fire.</p>

<p>“They’re afraid of it all right!” exclaimed
Ned. “I guess it will do the business.”</p>

<p>Sure enough, there seemed to be a desire on the
part of the snakes to clear out of the vicinity of
the hair rope. They glided off by scores, and soon
there was a clear space all about the car, where, before,
there had been hundreds of the crawling
things.</p>

<p>“Shake the lasso,” suggested Bob, “and maybe
it will scare them farther off.”</p>

<p>“Yes and we might try shooting a few now they
are at a safe distance,” put in Ned.</p>

<p>“It’s too bad I can’t get some specimens,” lamented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the professor, “but I suppose you had better
try to get rid of them.”</p>

<p>So Jerry, who had retained one end of the long
lasso vibrated it rapidly, and, as it wiggled in
sinuous folds toward the reptiles they made haste
to get out of the way. Then Bob and Ned
opened fire, killing several. In a little while there
were no snakes to be seen.</p>

<p>“I guess we can go ahead now,” said Jerry.
“Who’ll crank up the car? Don’t all speak at
once.”</p>

<p>“My arm is a bit sore,” spoke Ned, rubbing his
elbow.</p>

<p>“Then you do it, Chunky,” asked the steersman.</p>

<p>“I think I have a stone in my foot,” said Bob,
making a wry face.</p>

<p>“Ha! Ha!” laughed Jerry. “Why don’t
you two own up and say you’re afraid there’s a
stray rattler or two under the machine, and you
think it may bite you?”</p>

<p>The two boys grinned sheepishly, and both made
a motion to get out.</p>

<p>“Stay where you are,” called the professor preparing
to leave from the side door of the tonneau.
“I’m used to snakes. I don’t believe there are
any left, but if there are I want them for specimens.
I’ll crank the car.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>So he got out and peered anxiously under the
body, while the boys waited in anxiety.</p>

<p>“No,” called the scientist, in discouraged tones,
“there are none left.”</p>

<p>He crawled out, covered with dust, which fact
he did not seem to mind, and then turned the crank
that sent the fly wheel over. Jerry turned on the
gasolene and threw in the spark, and, the next instant
the familiar chug-chug of the engine told
that the auto was ready to bear the boys and Professor
Snodgrass on their way.</p>

<p>They were headed on as straight a road as they
could find to the Rio Grande, but, because of the
conditions of the thoroughfares it would be several
days before they could cross the big river and get
into Texas. Their main concern now was to reach
some place where there was shelter for the night.</p>

<p>“Keep your eyes peeled for villages,” called
Ned. “We don’t want to pass any. I think a
good bed would go fine now.”</p>

<p>“A supper would go better,” put in Bob.</p>

<p>“Oh, of course! It wouldn’t be Chunky if he
didn’t say something about eating,” remarked
Jerry with a laugh. “But there seems to be something
ahead. It’s a house at all events, and probably
is the mark of the outskirts of the village.”</p>

<p>On the left side of the road, about a hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
yards ahead they saw an adobe, or mud hut. They
could see no signs of life about in the half-darkness,
illuminated as it was by the powerful search light,
but this gave them no concern, as they knew the
native Mexicans retired early.</p>

<p>When they came opposite the hut Jerry brought
the machine to a stop, and he and the other boys
jumped out. The professor, who, as usual was
arranging some specimens in one of the many small
boxes he carried, remained in the car.</p>

<p>“Hello!” shouted Bob. “Is any one home?
Show a light. Can we get a supper here?”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you ask for a bed too?” inquired
Ned.</p>

<p>“Supper first,” replied Chunky, rubbing his
stomach with a reflective air.</p>

<p>No replies came to the hail of the boys, and, in
some wonder they approached nearer to the hut.
Then they saw that the door was ajar, and that the
cabin bore every appearance of being deserted.</p>

<p>“Nobody home, I guess,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“No, and there hasn’t been for some time,”
added Ned.</p>

<p>“Maybe there’s a place to build a fire where we
can cook a good meal,” put in Bob, whereat his
companions laughed.</p>

<p>They went into the hut, and found, that, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
it was in good condition, and furnished as well as
the average native Mexican’s abode, there was no
sign of life.</p>

<p>“Might as well make ourselves to home,” said
Ned. “Come on in, professor,” he called.
“We’ll stay here all night. No use traveling
further when there is such a good shelter right at
hand.”</p>

<p>It was now quite dark, and the boys brought in
the two oil lamps from the auto, as well as a
lantern, to illuminate the place. As they did so
they disturbed a colony of bats which flew out with
a great flutter of wings.</p>

<p>“There’s a charcoal stove, and plenty of fuel,”
said Bob, as he looked at the hearth. “Now
we can cook something.”</p>

<p>“Well, seeing you are so fond of eating, we’ll
let you get the meal,” said Jerry, and it was voted
that Chunky should perform this office.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the others brought in blankets to
make beds on the frame work of cane that formed
the sleeping quarters of whoever had last lived in
the hut.</p>

<p>“Rather queer sort of a shack,” remarked Jerry,
as he sat down in a corner on a pile of rugs.
“Seems to have been left suddenly. They didn’t
even stop to take the dishes, and here is the remains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
of a meal,” and he pointed to some dried frijoles
in one corner of the main room or kitchen.</p>

<p>“Perhaps the people who lived here were frightened
away,” came from Ned.</p>

<p>“Well I’m tired enough not to let anything
short of a regiment of soldiers in action scare me
awake to-night,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>Under Bob’s direction supper was soon ready,
and the travelers sat down to a good, if rather
limited meal as far as variety went. There were
no dishes to be washed, for they ate off wooden
plates, of which they had a quantity and which
they threw away after each meal. Then, after a
good fire had been built on the hearth&mdash;for the
night was likely to be chilly&mdash;the boys and the
professor wrapped themselves up in their blankets
and soon fell asleep.</p>

<p>Jerry must have been slumbering for several
hours when he suddenly awakened as he heard a
loud noise.</p>

<p>“Who’s there?” he called involuntarily, sitting
up.</p>

<p>It was so dark that at first he could distinguish
nothing, but, as his eyes became used to the blackness
he managed to make out, by the glow of the
fire, a shadowy figure gliding toward the door.</p>

<p>“Who’s there?” called the boy sharply, feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
under the rolled up blanket that served for a pillow,
for his revolver. “Stop or I’ll fire!”</p>

<p>The shadowy figure halted. Then Jerry saw it
drop down on all fours and begin to creep toward
him. Though he was not a coward the boy felt
his heart beating strangely, and he had a queer,
creepy sensation down his spine.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Ned, who was
awakened by Jerry’s voice.</p>

<p>“Get your revolver, quick!” called Jerry.
“There is some one in the hut besides ourselves!
Look over by the fire!”</p>

<p>“I see it! Shall I shoot?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>There came a sudden crash, followed by a wild
yell.</p>

<p>“Help! Help! I’m killed! They are murdering
me!” shouted Bob’s voice. “They are
choking me to death!”</p>

<p><em>Bang!</em> went Ned’s gun.</p>

<p>Fortunately it was aimed at the ceiling, or some
one might have been hurt.</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble?” inquired the professor,
who only just then awoke.</p>

<p>“Robbers!” yelled Bob.</p>

<p>“Brigands!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>“Some one is in the cabin!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>By this time he had managed to creep over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
toward the fire, on which he threw some light
wood. The glowing embers caught it, and as the
blaze flared up it revealed a big monkey tangled
up amid the folds of Bob’s blanket, while Chunky
was buried somewhere beneath the pile. The
beast was struggling wildly to escape, but Bob, in
his terror, had grabbed it by a leg.</p>

<p>“Stop your noise!” commanded Jerry.
“You’re not hurt, Chunky!”</p>

<p>“Are you sure they haven’t killed me?” asked
Bob, releasing his hold on the beast, which, with a
wild chatter of fear, fled from the hut.</p>

<p>“You ought to be able to give the best evidence
on that score,” said Jerry, as he lighted one of the
lamps.</p>

<p>“The fellow tried to choke me,” sputtered Bob.</p>

<p>“I guess the poor beast was as badly scared as
you were,” remarked the professor. “It was
probably attracted in here by the light and warmth.
Well, we seem bound to run up against excitement,
night as well as day.”</p>

<p>“The monkey must have knocked something
over,” said Jerry. “I was awakened by the sound
of something falling.”</p>

<p>They looked and saw that the beast had tried to
eat the remains of the supper, and had upset a big
pot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>“I was sure it was a man, at first,” explained
Jerry, “and when I saw it go down and start over
toward me I was afraid it was some of those
Mexican brigands that traveled with Vasco Bilette
and Noddy Nixon, when those rascals were on our
trail.”</p>

<p>It was some time before the excitement caused
by the monkey’s visit died down sufficiently to allow
the travelers to go to sleep again. It was
morning when they awoke, and prepared to get
breakfast.</p>

<p>“We need some water to make coffee,” said
Jerry, who had agreed to get the morning meal.
“As chief cook and bottle washer I delegate Bob
to find some. Take the pail in the auto.”</p>

<p>Bob started for the receptacle, and, as he reached
the door of the hut he gave a cry.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” called Jerry and Ned.</p>

<p>“There’s a man out here,” replied Bob.</p>

<p>“Well, he won’t bite you,” said Jerry. “Who
is he?”</p>

<p>“Pardon, senors,” called a voice, and then, into
the hut staggered a Mexican, who bore evidences
of having passed through a hard fight. His face
was cut and bruised, one arm hung limply at his
side, and his clothing was torn.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” cried Jerry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>Before the stranger could reply he had fallen
forward in a faint.</p>

<p>“Bring some water! Quick!” called Ned.</p>

<p>“Let me see to him! I have a little liquor
here!” exclaimed the professor, kneeling down beside
the prostrate form.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />
<small>NEWS FROM THE MINE</small></h2>


<p>By the use of the strong stimulant the Mexican
was revived. His eyes opened, and he sat up,
muttering something in Spanish which the boys
could not catch.</p>

<p>The professor, however, made reply, and, at the
words the stranger seemed to brighten up. He
drank some water, and then, at the suggestion of
Mr. Snodgrass the boys brought him some food,
which the native ate as if he had fasted for a week.</p>

<p>His hunger satisfied, he began to talk rapidly
to the professor, who listened attentively.</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble?” asked Jerry at length.</p>

<p>“It seems that the poor man lives in this hut,”
explained the scientist. “Night before last some
robbers came in, took nearly everything he had and
beat him. Then, driving him into the forest they
left him. Only just now did he dare to venture
back, fearing to find his enemies in possession of
his home. He is weak from lack of food and
from the treatment he received.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys felt sorry for the Mexican, and, at
Jerry’s suggestion they gave him a sum of money,
which, while it was small enough to the travelers,
meant a great deal to the native. He poured forth
voluble thanks.</p>

<p>As the boys and the professor were anxious to
get under way, a start was made as soon as it
was found that the native was not badly hurt, and
that he was able to summon help from friends in
a near-by village if necessary. With final leave-takings
the travelers started off.</p>

<p>For several days and nights they journeyed
north, toward the Rio Grande, which river separated
them from the United States. Once they
crossed that they would be in Texas.</p>

<p>“And we can’t get there any too soon,” remarked
Bob, one morning after a sleepless night,
passed in the open, during which innumerable fleas
attacked the travelers.</p>

<p>It was toward dusk, one evening, about a week
after having left the City of Mexico that the boys
and the professor found themselves on a road,
which, upon inquiry led to a small Mexican town,
on the bank of the Rio Grande, nearly opposite
Eagle Pass, Texas.</p>

<p>“Shall we cross over to-night or wait until morning?”
asked the professor of the boys. “Probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
it would be better to wait until daylight. I
could probably gather a few more specimens then.”</p>

<p>This was something of which the scientist, who
rejoiced in such letters as A.M.; Ph.D.; M.D.; F.
R. G. S.; A. G. S., etc., after his name, all indicating
some college honor conferred upon him,
never seemed to tire. He was making a collection
for his own college, as well as gathering data
for four large books, which, some day, he intended
to issue.</p>

<p>“I’d rather get over on our land if we can,”
said Ned, and he seemed to voice the sentiments
of the others.</p>

<p>So it was decided, somewhat against the professor’s
wish, to run the automobile on the big
flat-bottomed scow, which served as a ferry, and
proceed across the stream.</p>

<p>Quite a crowd of villagers came out to see the
auto as it chug-chugged up to the ferry landing,
and not a few of the children and dogs were in
danger of being run over until Ned, who was
steering, cut out the muffler, and the explosions of
the gasolene, unconfined by any pipes, made so
much noise that all except the grown men were
frightened away.</p>

<p>There was no one at the ferry house, and after
diligent inquiries it was learned that the captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
and crew of the boat had gone off to a dance about
five miles away.</p>

<p>“I guess we’ll have to stay on this side after
all,” remarked the professor. “I think&mdash;”</p>

<p>What he thought he did not say, for just then
he happened to catch sight of something on the
shoulder of one of the Mexicans, who had gathered
in a fringe about the machine.</p>

<p>“Stand still, my dear man!” called the professor,
as with cat-like tread he crept toward the
native.</p>

<p>“Diabalo! Santa Maria! Carramba!” muttered
the man, thinking, evidently, that the old
scientist was out of his wits.</p>

<p>“Don’t move! Please don’t move!” pleaded
Mr. Snodgrass, forgetting in his excitement that
his hearer could not understand his language.
“There is a beautiful specimen of a Mexican katy-did
on your coat. If I get it I will have a specimen
worth at least thirty dollars!”</p>

<p>He made a sudden motion. The Mexican mistook
the import of it, and, seemingly thinking he
was about to be assaulted, raised his hand in self
defense, and aimed a blow at the professor.</p>

<p>It was only a glancing one, but it knocked the
scientist down, and he fell into the road.</p>

<p>“There, the katy-did got away after all,” Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Snodgrass exclaimed, not seeming to mind his personal
mishap in the least.</p>

<p>This time the professor spoke in Spanish. The
Mexican understood, and was profuse in his apologies.
He conversed rapidly with his companions,
and, all at once there was a wild scramble after
katy-dids. So successful was the hunt that the
professor was fairly burdened with the insects.
He took as many as he needed, and thanked his
newly found friends for their efforts.</p>

<p>Matters quieted down after a bit. Darkness
fell rapidly and, the Mexican on whom the professor
had seen the katy-did invited the travelers
to dine with him.</p>

<p>He proved to be one of the principal men of the
village, and his house, though not large, was well
fitted up. The boys and the professor enjoyed the
best meal they had eaten since leaving the City of
Mexico.</p>

<p>“Do me the honor to spend the night here,”
said the Mexican, after the meal.</p>

<p>“Thank you, if it will not disturb your household
arrangements, we will,” replied the professor.
“We must make an early start, however, and cross
the river the first thing in the morning.”</p>

<p>“It will be impossible,” replied Senor Gerardo,
their host.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why so?”</p>

<p>“Because to-morrow starts the Feast of San
Juarez, which lasts for three days, and not a soul
in town, including the ferry-master, will work in
that time.”</p>

<p>“What are we to do?” asked Mr. Snodgrass.</p>

<p>“If you do not cross to-night you will not be
able to make the passage until the end of the
week,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Then let’s start to-night,” spoke Jerry. “We
went over the Rio Grande after dark once before.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and a pretty mess we made of it,” said
Ned, referring to the collision they had with the
house-boat, as told of in “The Motor Boys in
Mexico.”</p>

<p>“But I thought they said the ferry-master was
away to a dance,” put in Bob.</p>

<p>“He is, Senor,” replied their host, who managed
to understand the boy’s poor Spanish. “However,
if he knew the Americanos wanted him, and would
go for him in their big marvelous&mdash;fire-spitting
wagon, and&mdash;er&mdash;that is if they offered him a
small sum, he might be prevailed upon to leave the
dance.”</p>

<p>“Let’s try it, at all events,” suggested Jerry.
“I’m anxious to get over the line and into the
United States. A stay of several days may mean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
one of a week. When these Mexicans get feasting
they don’t know when to stop.”</p>

<p>He spoke in English, so as not to offend their
kind friend.</p>

<p>It was arranged that Jerry and Senor Gerardo
should go in the auto for the ferry-master, and
summon him to the river with his men, who could
come on their fast ponies.</p>

<p>This was done, and, though the master of the
boat demurred at leaving the pleasures of the
dance, he consented when Jerry casually showed a
gold-piece. He and his men were soon mounted
and galloped along, Jerry running the auto slowly
to keep pace with them. The five miles were
quickly covered and, while half the population of
the village came out to see the strange machine
ferried over, the boys and the professor bade farewell
to the country where they had gone through so
many strange adventures.</p>

<p>It was nearly ten o’clock when the big flat-bottomed
boat grounded on the opposite shore of the
Rio Grande.</p>

<p>“Hurrah for the United States!” exclaimed
Bob. “Now I can get a decent meal without having
to swallow red peppers, onions and chocolate!”</p>

<p>“There goes Chunky again,” laughingly complained
Ned. “No sooner does he land than he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
wants to feed his stomach. I believe if he had
been with Christopher Columbus the first thing he
would have inquired about on landing at San Salvador
would be what the Indians had good to
eat.”</p>

<p>“Oh you’re as bad as I am, every bit!” said
Bob.</p>

<p>Eagle’s Pass, where the travelers landed, was a
typical Texas town, with what passed for a hotel,
a store and a few houses where the small population
lived. It was on the edge of the border
prairies and the outlying districts were occupied by
cattle ranches.</p>

<p>Nearly all, if not quite all, of the male population
came down to the dock to see the unusual
sight of a big touring automobile on the ferry boat.
Many were the comments made by the ranchmen
and herders.</p>

<p>After much pulling and hauling the car was
rolled from the big scow, and the travelers, glad
to feel that they were once more in their own
country, began to think of a place to spend the
night.</p>

<p>“Where is the nearest hotel?” asked Jerry of a
man in the crowd.</p>

<p>“Ain’t but one, stranger, an’ it’s right in front
of you,” was the reply, as the cowboy pointed to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
small, one story building across the street from
the river front.</p>

<p>“Is Professor Driedgrass in that bunch?” asked
a voice as the travelers were contemplating the
hostelry. “If he is I have a letter for him.”</p>

<p>“I am Professor Snodgrass,” replied the scientist,
looking toward the man who had last spoken.</p>

<p>“Beg your pardon, Professor Snodgrass. I
kinder got my brands mixed,” the stranger went
on. “Anyhow I’m th’ postmaster here, an’ I’ve
been holdin’ a letter for ye most a week. It says
it’s to be delivered to a man with three boys an’ a
choo-choo wagon, an’ that description fits you.”</p>

<p>“Where’s it from?” asked Mr. Snodgrass.</p>

<p>“Come in a letter to me, from a feller named
Nestor, up at a place in the mining section,” was
the reply. “Th’ letter to me said you might likely
pass this way on your journey back.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />
<small>TROUBLE AHEAD</small></h2>


<p>“I remember now, I did write to Nestor, telling
him we were about to start back, and would
probably cross the river at this place,” spoke the
professor. “I had forgotten all about it.”</p>

<p>“Well, here’s your letter,” said the postmaster.
“Now allow me to welcome you to our city, which
I do in the name of the Mayor&mdash;which individual
you see in me&mdash;and the Common Council, which
consists of Pete Blaston, only he ain’t here, in consequent
of bein’ locked up for disturbin’ th’ peace
an’ quiet of the community by shootin’ a Greaser.”</p>

<p>“Glad to meet you, I am sure,” replied the
scientist politely, as he received the letter from the
dual official.</p>

<p>“What is the news from Nestor?” asked Jerry
anxiously. “Is the mine all right?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you right away,” replied Mr. Snodgrass,
as, by the light of the gas lantern on the
auto he read the letter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>As he glanced rapidly over the pages his face
took on an anxious look.</p>

<p>“Is there anything wrong?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“There is indeed,” replied the professor
gravely. “The letter was written over a week
ago, and, among other things Nestor says there is
likely to be trouble over the mine.”</p>

<p>“What kind? Is Noddy Nixon trying to get
it away from us again?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“No,” replied Mr. Snodgrass. “It appears
our title is not as good as it might be. There is
one of the former owners of the land where the
mine is located who did not sign the deed. He
was missing when the transfer was made, but Nestor
did not know this, so there is a cloud on our
title.”</p>

<p>“But I thought we claimed the land from the
government, and were the original owners,” put
in Ned.</p>

<p>“It seems that a company of men owned the
mine before we did, but they sold out to Nestor
and some of his friends. They all signed the deed
but this one man, and now some one has learned
of this, and seeks to take the mine, on the theory
that they have as good a claim to the holding as
we have.”</p>

<p>“I should say that was trouble,” sighed Bob.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
“To think of losing what we worked so hard to
get!”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s no use crossing a bridge until
you come to it,” Professor Snodgrass went on.
“Nestor and his friends are in possession yet, and
that, you know, is nine of the ten points of the
law.”</p>

<p>“Then if we can’t do anything right away I
move we have something to eat,” suggested Bob.</p>

<p>“It’s a good suggestion,” agreed the scientist.</p>

<p>They had drawn a little to one side from the
crowd of townspeople while talking about the letter
from Nestor, but, having decided there was nothing
to be done at present, they moved toward the
hotel.</p>

<p>“I reckon I’ve got some more mail for your outfit,
Professor Hayseed&mdash;er I beg yer pardon&mdash;Snodgrass,”
said the postmaster-mayor. “There’s
letters fer chaps named Baker, Slade and Hopkins.
Nestor sent ’em along with that other,” and the
dual official handed over three envelopes.</p>

<p>“They’re from home!” cried the boys in a
chorus. And in the glare of oil lamps on the
porch of the hotel they read the communications.</p>

<p>The missives contained nothing but good news,
to the effect that all the loved ones were well.
Each one inquired anxiously how much longer the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
travelers expected to stay away, and urged them
to come home as soon as they could.</p>

<p>“Now for that supper!” exclaimed Bob, as he
put his letter away.</p>

<p>If the meal was a rough one, prepared as it was
by the Chinese cook, it was good, and the travelers
enjoyed it thoroughly. As they rose from the
table a cowboy entered the dining room and
drawled out:</p>

<p>“I say strangers, be you th’ owners of that
there rip-snortin’ specimen of th’ lower regions
that runs on four wheels tied ’round with big
sassages?”</p>

<p>“Do you mean the automobile?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“I reckon I do, if that’s what ye call it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s our machine,” replied Jerry.</p>

<p>“Then if ye have any great love for th’
workin’ of it in the future, an’ any regard or consideration
for it’s feelin’ ye ought t’ see to it.”</p>

<p>“Why so?”</p>

<p>“Nothin’,” drawled the cowboy as he carefully
pared his nails with a big bowie knife;
“nothin’ only Bronco Pete is amusin’ his self
by tryin’ t’ see how near he can come to stickin’
his scalpin’ steel inter th’ tires!”</p>

<p>“Great Scott! We must stop that!” exclaimed
Jerry, running from the hotel toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
where the auto had been left in the street. The
other boys and the professor followed.</p>

<p>They found the machine surrounded by quite
a crowd that seemed to be much amused at something
which was taking place in its midst. Making
their way to the inner circle of spectators the
boys beheld an odd sight.</p>

<p>A big cowboy, who, from appearances had
indulged too freely in something stronger than
water, was unsteadily trying to stick his big knife
into the rubber tires.</p>

<p>“Here! You mustn’t do that,” cried Jerry,
sharply, laying his hand on the man’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Look out for him! He’s dangerous!”
warned some of the bystanders.</p>

<p>“I can’t help it if he is,” replied Jerry. “We
can’t let him ruin the tires.”</p>

<p>“This is the time I do it!” cried Bronco Pete,
as he made a lunge for the front wheel. Jerry
sprang forward and the crowd held its breath,
for it seemed as if the boy was right in the path
of the knife.</p>

<p>But Jerry knew what he was about. With a
quick motion he kicked the cowboy lightly on the
wrist, the blow knocking the knife from his hand,
and sending it some distance away.</p>

<p>“Look out now, sonny!” called a man to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Jerry. “No one ever hit Pete an’ lived after it.”</p>

<p>It seemed that Jerry was in a dangerous position.
Pete, enraged at being foiled of his purpose,
uttered a beast-like roar, and reached back
to where his revolver rested at his hip in a belt.
Jerry never moved an inch, but looked the man
straight in the eye.</p>

<p>“Here! None of that Pete!” called a voice
suddenly, and a big man pushed his way through
the crowd, and grabbed the cowboy’s arm before
he had time to draw his gun. “If you don’t want
to get into trouble move on!”</p>

<p>“All right, Marshall; all right,” replied Pete,
the desire of shooting seeming to die out as he
looked at the newcomer. “I were only havin’ a
little fun with th’ tenderfoot.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t appear to scare him much,” remarked
the town marshall, who had seen the whole
thing. “You had your nerve with you all right,
son,” he added, to Jerry.</p>

<p>“That’s what he had,” commented Pete.
“There ain’t many men would have done what
he did, an’ I admire him for it. Put it there,
stranger,” and Pete, all the anger gone from him,
extended a big hand, which Jerry grasped heartily.</p>

<p>“Three cheers for the ‘tenderfoot,’” called
some one, and they were given with a will for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Jerry, as Pete, under the guidance of the marshall,
moved unsteadily away.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t have been in your boots one spell
there, for a good bit,” observed the postmaster as
he came up. “Pete’s about as bad as they come.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t stop to think of the danger, or maybe
I wouldn’t have done as I did,” said Jerry. “All
I thought of was that he would spoil the tire, and
it would take a long while to fix it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and we don’t want to delay any longer
than we can help,” spoke Ned in a low voice.
“I’m anxious to get back to the mine and see what
we can do to perfect our title.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
<small>ON A STRANGE ROAD</small></h2>


<p>For several days they made good progress, for
the roads were in fair condition. The machine
was kept headed as nearly as possible toward Arizona,
though they often had to go some distance
out of their way to get rid of bad places, or find
a ford or bridge to cross a stream.</p>

<p>“We’ll soon be out of Texas,” remarked Bob
one afternoon, when they had passed through a
small ranch town where they had dinner.</p>

<p>“And I think we’re going to get a wetting before
we leave the big state,” put in Ned.</p>

<p>“I think you’re right,” agreed the professor, as
he turned and looked at a bank of ugly dark
clouds in the southwest. “A thunder shower is
coming up, if I’m any judge. There doesn’t seem
to be any shelter, either.”</p>

<p>As far as they could see there was nothing but
a vast stretch of wild country, though, far to the
north, there was a dark patch which looked as if
it was a forest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s coming just at the wrong time,” remarked
Jerry, who was steering. “I was in hopes the
storm would hold off a bit. Well, we shan’t melt
if it does rain.”</p>

<p>And that it was soon going to pour in the proverbial
buckets full was evident. The wind began
to blow a half gale, and the clouds, from which
angry streaks of jagged lightning leaped, scurried
forward. At the same time low mutterings of
thunder were heard.</p>

<p>“We’re in for it,” cried Bob.</p>

<p>The next instant the storm broke, and the whole
landscape was blotted out in a veil of mist and
rain which came down in sheets of water. Now
and then the darkness would be illuminated by a
vivid flash of fire from the sky artillery, and the
thunder seemed to shake the earth.</p>

<p>Jerry could barely see where to steer, so fiercely
did the rain beat down. Fortunately they had
time to put on their raincoats before the deluge hit
them.</p>

<p>The provisions and other things in the auto
had, likewise, been covered up with canvas, so
little damage would result from the downpour.</p>

<p>“Look out!” yelled Ned suddenly to Jerry.
“There’s something ahead of us!”</p>

<p>Jerry partially shut off the power, and, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
machine slowed down, he and the others peered
forward to see what the object was.</p>

<p>“It’s some sort of an animal!” cried Bob, who
had sharp eyes. “It’s running along on four
legs, right in front of the car!”</p>

<p>“It’s a bear, that’s what it is!” shouted Ned.
“A big black bear!”</p>

<p>“Let me get it for a specimen!” exclaimed the
professor, in his enthusiasm, not considering the
size of the animal, nor the difficulties in the way
of capturing it. “Let me get out! It’s worth
forty dollars if it’s worth a cent!”</p>

<p>At the sound of the excited voices, which the
animal must have heard above the roar of the
storm, the bear turned suddenly and faced the
occupants of the car. So quickly was it done that
Jerry had barely time to jam on the brakes in
order to avoid a collision.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you run him down, and we could
have some bear steaks for supper?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Because I don’t think it’s just healthy to run
into a three hundred and fifty pound bear with a
big auto,” replied Jerry. “We might kill the
bear, but we’d be sure to damage the car.”</p>

<p>The beast did not appear to be frightened at
the sight of his natural enemies. Raising on its
haunches the animal slowly ambled toward the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
stalled machine, growling in a menacing manner.</p>

<p>“I believe he’s going to attack us!” exclaimed
the professor. “Let me get out my rifle!”</p>

<p>But this was easier said than done. The weapons
and ammunition were all under the canvas,
and it would require several minutes to get at
them.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile <a href="#image01">the bear</a>, showing every indication
of rage <a href="#image01">was trying to climb up on the
engine hood</a>, despite the throbbing of the engine,
which was going, though the gears were not
thrown in.</p>

<p>“Start the car and run over him!” exclaimed
Bob.</p>

<p>“Back up and get out of his way!” was Ned’s
advice to Jerry.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to do something,” muttered the steersman.</p>

<p>Matters were getting critical. The storm was
increasing in violence, with the wind lashing the
rain into the faces of the travelers. The growls
of the angry beast mingled with the rumble and
rattle of thunder, and the machine was shaking
under the efforts Bruin made to climb over the
hood and into the front seat.</p>

<p>“Hold on tight! I’m going to start!” yelled
Jerry suddenly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>He threw in the intermediate gear and opened
wide the gasolene throttle. The car sprang forward
like a thing alive. But the bear had too
good a hold with his long sharp claws sticking in
the ventilator holes of the hood, to be shaken off.</p>

<p>“I should think he’d burn on the water radiator,”
said Ned.</p>

<p>“His fur’s too thick I guess,” was Bob’s reply.</p>

<p>On went the auto, the boys and the professor
clinging to it for dear life, while Bruin hung on,
half crazed with fear and anger.</p>

<p>“How you going to get rid of him?” shouted
Ned above the roar of the storm.</p>

<p>“I’ll show you,” replied Jerry grimly.</p>

<p>Some distance ahead the steersman had seen a
sharp curve in the road. It was dimly discernible
through the mist of water.</p>

<p>“Hold tight everybody!” shouted Jerry a second
or two before the turn was reached.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly swinging around it, at as sharp
an angle as he dared to make and not overturn
the car, Jerry sent the auto skidding. The next
instant, unable to stand the impetus of the turn,
the bear lost its hold on the hood, and was flung,
like a stone from a catapult, far off to the left,
rolling over and over on the muddy ground.</p>

<p>“There, I guess it will be quite a while before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
he tries to eat up another live automobile,” remarked
Jerry as he slowed up a bit.</p>

<p>Off in the distance they heard a sort of reproachful
whine, as if Bruin objected to such
treatment. Then the rain came down harder than
ever, and all sight of the bear was lost.</p>

<p>“Let’s get out of this!” exclaimed Ned, as he
felt a small stream of water trickling down his
back. “Can’t we strike for those woods we saw
a while ago?”</p>

<p>“I’m headed for them,” spoke Jerry. “I just
want to get my bearings. Guess we’d better light
up, as it will soon be dusk.”</p>

<p>After some difficulty in getting matches to burn
in the wind and rain, the big search lights and the
oil lanterns were lighted, and then, with four
shafts of light cutting the misty darkness ahead of
them the travelers proceeded.</p>

<p>The roads seemed to be getting worse, but there
was nothing to do except to keep on. Every now
and then the machine would lurch into some hollow
with force enough to almost break the springs.</p>

<p>“Hello!” cried Jerry suddenly. “Here are
two roads. Which shall we take?”</p>

<p>“The right seems to go a little more directly
north,” said the professor, peering forward.
“Suppose we take that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>“Especially as it seems to be the better road,”
added Jerry.</p>

<p>He turned the machine into it, and, to the surprise
of all they felt the thoroughfare become hard
and firm as the auto tires rolled over it. It was
almost as smooth as asphalt, and the travelers were
congratulating themselves on having made a wise
choice.</p>

<p>All at once the rain, which had been coming
down in torrents, seemed to let up.</p>

<p>“I believe it’s clearing up,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“No, it’s because we’ve run into a dense forest,
and the trees above keep the rain off,” spoke the
professor.</p>

<p>The others looked about them and saw that this
was so. On every side the glare of the lamps
showed big trunks and leafy branches, while ahead
more trees could be observed.</p>

<p>“Why it’s just like a tunnel in the woods,” said
Bob. “See, the trees seem to meet in an arch
overhead.”</p>

<p>“And what a fine road it is,” put in Ned.</p>

<p>“An altogether strange sort of road,” agreed
Jerry. “Suppose we stop and look about before
we go any further? I don’t like the looks of it.”</p>

<p>Accordingly the machine was brought to a halt,
and the travelers alighted. They found it just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
as Bob had said, almost exactly like an immense
tunnel in the forest. Beneath their feet the road
was of the finest Macadam construction.</p>

<p>“And to think of finding this in the midst of
Texas,” observed Jerry.</p>

<p>“Some one built this road, and cut the trees to
make this tunnel,” remarked the professor. “I
wonder what sort of a place we have stumbled
into.”</p>

<p>“At all events it doesn’t rain anything to speak
of in here,” said Bob, “and it’s a good place to
stay until the storm is over.”</p>

<p>Jerry, in the meanwhile had walked on ahead
some distance. In a few minutes he came hurrying
back. His manner showed that he had seen
something.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked the professor.</p>

<p>“Don’t make any noise, but follow me,” replied
the lad.</p>

<p>In silence, and wondering what was about to
happen, Bob, Ned and the scientist trailed after
Jerry. He led them several hundred feet ahead
of the automobile, and away from the glare of the
lamps, the tunnel curving somewhat.</p>

<p>“See!” whispered Jerry, hoarsely.</p>

<p>“Well, I never!”</p>

<p>“That’s queer!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>There, about three hundred feet to the left of
the main road and on a sort of side path, the
travelers saw a small hut, brilliantly lighted up.
Through an open window, a room could be seen,
and several figures moving about in it.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
<small>THE RESCUE OF TOMMY BELL</small></h2>


<p>“I wonder who they can be, to hide off in the
woods this way,” whispered Bob.</p>

<p>The next instant there floated out from the hut
a cry of anguish. It was the voice of a boy,
seemingly in great pain or fear, and the travelers
heard the words:</p>

<p>“Oh don’t! Please don’t! You are killing
me! I don’t know! I can’t tell you, for I would
if I could! Oh! Oh! Please don’t burn me
again!”</p>

<p>“It’s a gang torturing some one!” almost
shouted Ned. “Let’s go to the rescue!”</p>

<p>He would have sprung forward had not Jerry
laid a detaining hand on his arm.</p>

<p>“Wait, Ned,” counseled Jerry. “Some one
there evidently needs our help, but we must go
with caution. First we must get our guns. We
may need them!”</p>

<p>Once more the appealing cry burst out.</p>

<p>“Quick!” whispered Jerry. “Professor, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
and Bob go back for the rifles, and bring the
bulls-eye lantern that has the dark slide to it.
Ned and I will stay here and watch!”</p>

<p>Mr. Snodgrass and Bob lost no time. In less
than five minutes they had rejoined Ned and
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Has anything happened?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Nothing since,” whispered Jerry. “Now
we will go forward. Every one have his gun
ready. I will carry the lantern.”</p>

<p>Almost as silently as shadows the four figures
stole forward, Jerry showing a cautious gleam
now and then to guide them on their way. They
found there was a fairly good path leading up to
the hut.</p>

<p>They had covered half the distance when once
more the cries of anguish burst out. This time
they were followed by angry shouts, seemingly
from several men, and voices in dispute could be
heard.</p>

<p>“One of us had better creep forward and see
what is going on inside the cabin,” whispered
Jerry. “We must know what sort of enemies we
have to meet.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go,” volunteered Bob.</p>

<p>“Better let me,” suggested the professor. “I
have had some experience in stalking animals, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
I can probably advance more quietly than you
can.”</p>

<p>They all saw the reasonableness of this and the
scientist started off. Like a cat he made an advance
until he was so close to the hut that he
could peer into the uncurtained window. What
he saw made him start back in terror.</p>

<p>In the room were half a dozen roughly dressed
men, all armed, and with brutal faces. The
room was filled with smoke from cigars and pipes,
and cards were scattered over a rough table in the
middle of the apartment.</p>

<p>But what attracted the attention of the professor
and made his heart beat fast in anger, was
the sight of a small, pale boy, bound with ropes
up against a big stone fireplace, on the hearth of
which logs were burning.</p>

<p>In front of the lad stood one of the largest and
strongest of the tough gang, and in his hand he
held a redhot poker, which, as the scientist
watched, he brought close to the bare legs of the
terror-stricken lad.</p>

<p>Then came again those heart-rending cries:</p>

<p>“Oh don’t! Please don’t! I would tell you
where he is if I knew! Please don’t burn me
again!”</p>

<p>The professor’s blood boiled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’ll soon put a stop to this horrible work!”
he exclaimed to himself as he glided back to where
the boys were and quickly made them acquainted
with what he had seen.</p>

<p>“Come on!” cried Jerry. “We must rescue
that boy!”</p>

<p>As softly as they could, the travelers advanced
toward the hut. They found the door and, while
the others with rifles in readiness stood in a semi-circle
about it, Jerry made ready to knock and demand
admittance.</p>

<p>“If they don’t open the door we must burst it
in,” said the boy. “The professor and I will
look to that, while you and Ned, Bob, must stand
ready to rush in right after us with your guns
ready. But don’t shoot unless your life is in danger,
and then fire not to kill, but to wound.”</p>

<p>There was a minute of hesitation, for they all
realized that it was taking a desperate chance to
tackle such a rough gang in the midst of woods,
far from civilization. But the sound of the poor
boy’s cries nerved them on as, once more, the pitiful
appeal for mercy rang out.</p>

<p>Jerry sprang forward and gave several vigorous
blows on the door with the butt of his gun. All
at once silence took the place of the confusion inside
the hut.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who’s there? What do you want?” asked
a gruff voice.</p>

<p>“Open the door! We want that boy!” cried
Jerry.</p>

<p>Confused murmurs from within told that the
gang had been taken by surprise.</p>

<p>“I don’t know who you are, but whoever you
are you had better move on, if you don’t want a
bullet through you,” called the man who had first
answered the knock. “This is none of your affair.”</p>

<p>“Open the door or we’ll burst it in!” cried
Jerry, knowing the best way to be successful in
the fight was to act quickly and take the men by
surprise.</p>

<p>There was a laugh from within the hut. It
was answered by a rending, crashing splintering
sound as Jerry and the professor, using the stocks
of their guns, began a vigorous attack on the portal.
The door was strong enough, but the hinges
were not, and, in less than half a minute the barrier
had given way and, with a bound the travelers
found themselves tumbling into the hut.</p>

<p>Instantly confusion reigned. The men shouted
hoarsely, and several tried to reach their guns,
which were stacked in one corner.</p>

<p>“Hands up!” commanded Jerry sharply, leveling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
his gun at the man who seemed to be the
leader.</p>

<p>“Why, they’re nothing but boys! Knock ’em
out of the way!” cried one of the gang. At the
same time another began creeping up behind
Jerry, his intention being to grab the lad from the
back and disarm him.</p>

<p>But Bob saw the movement, and, leveling his
rifle at the fellow, told him to halt.</p>

<p>“I guess you’ve got the drop on us,” growled
the man whom Jerry was covering with the gun.
“What’s the game anyhow? Are you stage robbers?”</p>

<p>“We want you to stop torturing that boy,”
cried Jerry.</p>

<p>“Why, that’s my kid, and I was only givin’
him a taste of the rod because he wouldn’t mind
me; ‘spare the rod and spoil the child,’ is a good
saying, you know.”</p>

<p>“Not from you!” snapped the professor.
“Is this man your father?” the scientist asked
the bound boy.</p>

<p>“Speak up now! Ain’t I your daddy?” put
in the leader, scowling at the boy.</p>

<p>“Tell the truth! Don’t let him scare you!”
said the professor reassuredly. “We are in
charge here now. Is he your father?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>“No&mdash;no&mdash;sir,” stammered the poor little
lad, and then he burst into tears.</p>

<p>“I thought so!” commented the scientist.
“Now you scoundrels clear out of here before we
cause your arrest!”</p>

<p>“You’re talkin’ mighty high,” sneered the
leader, “but look out! This matter is none of
your affair, and that boy belongs to us!”</p>

<p>“Take me away! Oh, please take me away!
They’ll kill me!” sobbed the lad.</p>

<p>There was such a fiery look in the professor’s
eye as he leveled his gun at the gang of men that
they started back, evidently fearing to be fired
upon.</p>

<p>“Come on!” called one. “We’ll get some of
the Mexicans and then we’ll see who’s runnin’
things around here!”</p>

<p>With that the gang sneaked out of the door,
leaving the boys and the professor master of the
situation. Their first act was to unbind the lad,
who was almost fainting from pain and fear.</p>

<p>“Are there any more of them?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the boy faintly. “There are a lot
of half-breed Mexicans in the gang. They are in
a hut about a mile farther up the road, where they
keep a lot of horses on a ranch.”</p>

<p>“Then perhaps we’d better get out of here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
while we have a chance,” said the professor.
“We can’t fight a score or more. Let’s take the
boy and hurry away.”</p>

<p>“Come on then,” said Jerry. “We’ll get
back to the auto. I only hope these men don’t
discover it and damage the car.”</p>

<p>But when an attempt to start was made it was
found that the boy, who said, in response to an
inquiry from Ned, that his name was Tommy
Bell, was unable to walk. The ropes bound
about his legs had caused the blood to stagnate in
the veins.</p>

<p>“Here!” exclaimed Jerry. “Bob, you and
Ned go ahead with the lantern, and the professor
and I will carry Tommy. Step lively now!”</p>

<p>Moving in that order the procession started,
and in a few minutes the travelers were back at
the machine, which did not seem to have been
disturbed. There was no sight or sound of the
gang.</p>

<p>Tommy was made as comfortable as possible,
and then there was a brief consultation.</p>

<p>“Which way had we better go?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“I think it would be best to turn around,” said
Bob. “We’ll run up against the gang if we go
ahead.”</p>

<p>“The best road is straight ahead through this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
woods,” spoke Tommy. “If you take the other
your machine will get stuck.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll take this one, and trust to luck not
to have any trouble with the gang,” decided Jerry,
as he cranked up the car.</p>

<p>Just as they started the moon came out from
the clouds, for the rain had ceased, and, though
not many of the silver beams shone through the
thick foliage, it was much lighter than it had been.
Jerry threw in the gear and the next instant the
car glided forward and shot along the tunnel of
trees, leaving the hut where Tommy Bell had
been a prisoner.</p>

<p>“Is the Mexican camp near this main road?”
asked the professor of Tommy.</p>

<p>“About three hundred feet in,” answered the
boy, who was feeling much better.</p>

<p>“How many men are at it?”</p>

<p>“About one hundred, I guess, from what I
heard them say.”</p>

<p>“Then I guess we’d better go past it on the
fly,” muttered Jerry, as he speeded up the machine
until it was skimming along at a fast rate.
In a little while there was a gleam of light
through the trees ahead.</p>

<p>“There’s the camp!” exclaimed Tommy.</p>

<p>A minute later the travelers were made well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
aware of it, for, as they whizzed past in the auto,
they heard shouts of anger, mingling with the
sounds of rushing feet, while an occasional pistol
shot rang out, the flash of fire cutting the darkness.</p>

<p>“They saw us,” spoke Bob. “Lucky it was
pretty dark, or they might have damaged the
auto.”</p>

<p>“To say nothing of ourselves,” added Ned.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br />
<small>PURSUED BY ENEMIES</small></h2>


<p>As the auto sped along, Professor Snodgrass
asked Tommy Bell how he had come to the hut in
the forest.</p>

<p>“Those men took me there,” replied the boy.</p>

<p>“And what did they try to make you do?”
asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“They wanted me to tell them where my
father was,” went on Tommy. “I could not because
I did not know, and they burned me, because
they did not believe I was telling the truth.”</p>

<p>“What did they want of your father?” inquired
Mr. Snodgrass.</p>

<p>“They want him to sign some papers connected
with some property,” went on Tommy. “I don’t
know much about it, except that father used to
work with those men developing a mine. It
didn’t pay, and they left it, after selling it to some
other men. I lived with my father, and my
mother was alive then.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>The boy stopped, and, at the mention of his
mother’s name began to cry softly.</p>

<p>“Poor little lad,” muttered the professor, putting
his arm, with a sort of caressing motion about
Tommy. “Don’t cry, lad,” the scientist went
on, in what seemed a sort of husky voice, for he
was very fond of children; “don’t worry, we’ll
look out for you; won’t we, boys?”</p>

<p>“You bet!” exclaimed Jerry, Ned and Bob in
one voice.</p>

<p>The auto was slowed down now, as there
seemed to be no danger of pursuit.</p>

<p>“After mother died,” Tommy resumed, “and
the mine did not pay, father started prospecting
with Nat Richards and the others in that crowd.
But they were bad men, and soon got the better of
my dad, taking away what little money he had
left.</p>

<p>“This ruined my father, and he grew discouraged,
for he was old, and in poor health. He
wandered away and I haven’t seen him for nearly
a year. I traveled about, doing what little work
I could get to do, until I struck Texas. One day,
about a week ago, I passed a ranch, the same one
we just came by. I asked for work, and got it.
Then I found the same men owned it that had
ruined my father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>“As soon as Nat Richards saw me he demanded
to know where dad was. I couldn’t tell,
and then he promised me one hundred dollars if I
would tell. He said they needed my father’s signature
to a paper.</p>

<p>“I don’t know as I would have told them
where dad was if I did know. When I kept on
refusing to give them the information, Nat Richards
grew ugly. He had me taken off to the hut
where you found me, and said he’d starve me to
death if I didn’t tell.</p>

<p>“I almost did die from hunger,” Tommy went
on with a catch in his voice. “Then they tried
torture. They burned me on the legs with a hot
poker. That’s what they were doing when you
came in,” and, overcome again by the thought of
all he had suffered Tommy cried bitterly.</p>

<p>The boys and the professor did all they could
to comfort the friendless lad, and, soon Tommy’s
grief wore off.</p>

<p>“We’ll take you along with us,” said Jerry
heartily, “and we’ll try to help you find your
father. Where did you see him last?”</p>

<p>“He was in Arizona,” answered Tommy.</p>

<p>“That’s just where we’re headed for,” exclaimed
Bob. “We’ll take you there all right.”</p>

<p>Jerry leaned forward to throw in the higher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
speed gear when there was a sudden ripping,
breaking sound, and the auto began to slow up.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Stripped the gear, I’m afraid,” replied the
steersman. “This is a nice pickle to be in.”</p>

<p>“Won’t it run on the low or intermediate
gear?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>Jerry tried them, and found they were all right.</p>

<p>“I guess we’d better stop here for the night,”
he said. “We may need the high gear any minute,
and perhaps I can fix it in the morning. I
have a spare wheel.”</p>

<p>“Then let’s camp and have supper,” said Bob
eagerly. “I haven’t eaten in a week by the way
I feel.”</p>

<p>“Same here! I agree with you for once,
Chunky,” spoke Jerry. “It has been a long time
since dinner, but with the excitement of the storm,
the bear, and rescuing Tommy I didn’t notice it
before.”</p>

<p>In a little while the camping outfit was taken
from the automobile, and a fire started in the
sheet-iron stove, with the charcoal that was carried
to be used in emergencies, such as being unable
to find dry wood after a rain.</p>

<p>Ned ground the coffee, while Bob went in
search of water, using the lantern to aid him in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the somewhat dim forest, though the moon helped
some. He found a spring close at hand, and soon
a fragrant beverage was steaming under the trees.
Then some bacon was placed in the frying pan,
and the hard tack was taken from the tin and other
things prepared.</p>

<p>“Fall to!” commanded Ned, who was acting
as cook, and fall to they all did, with a will.</p>

<p>“Do you often camp out and eat in the woods
like this?” asked Tommy. “I think it’s jolly
fun,” and the lad, who was about twelve years
old, laughed for the first time since his rescue.
He, too, was eating with an appetite that showed
he needed the food.</p>

<p>Jerry briefly related some of their travel adventures,
at which Tommy opened his eyes to their
widest extent.</p>

<p>“Cracky! But you have had stunning
times!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>The meal having been finished, they began to
think of getting some sleep. Blankets were
brought out, and rolling themselves up in them the
boys and the professor were soon in the land of
nod.</p>

<p>It was nearly dawn when Jerry was suddenly
awakened by the far off baying of a dog. At
first he could not imagine what the sound was, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
sat up to listen more intently. Then a long,
mournful howl was borne to him on the wind.</p>

<p>“That’s strange,” he muttered. “There are
very few dogs about here. I wonder what it is.”</p>

<p>At the same time Tommy Bell roused up, and
he, too, heard the sound.</p>

<p>“It’s the gang after us!” he exclaimed.
“They have a lot of hounds on the ranch!
Hurry up! Let’s get out of this!”</p>

<p>“Hark!” exclaimed Jerry, raising his hand.</p>

<p>Then the boys heard, faint and far off, the
sound of galloping horses.</p>

<p>“They’re coming!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>His cry awakened the others, who sat up bewildered
and heavy from sound sleep.</p>

<p>“Lively’s the word!” called Jerry. “They’re
after us!”</p>

<p>No further explanation was needed, for all
knew what Jerry meant. There was a hasty piling
of blankets into the auto; the stove was packed
up, and, while the travelers jumped into the car,
Jerry went in front to crank it up. The cheerful
chug-chug told that the machinery was in good
working order, and then, the boy, leaping into the
steersman’s seat, threw in the low gear for the
start.</p>

<p>As he did so Ned glanced back and saw, coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
around the bend of the forest road a score of
horsemen and a pack of dogs.</p>

<p>“Speed her up, Jerry!” called Bob.</p>

<p>“I will!” was the exclamation, as Jerry leaned
forward to throw in the high gear. A mournful
screeching of the engine was the only response.</p>

<p>“I forgot! The high gear is broken!” the
steersman cried. “We can only use the intermediate,
and that is not very fast!”</p>

<p>“It’s the best we can do, though!” said Bob.
“We may get away from them!”</p>

<p>On the intermediate cogs the auto made good
speed, and, for a while, distanced the gang, the
members of which, with shouts of rage, put their
horses to their best effort.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />
<small>INTO THE CAVE</small></h2>


<p>The sun began to peep up from beneath the
eastern hills, throwing a rosy light over the earth.
The woods began to thin out, and the sides of the
“tunnel,” which had been dense, became more
open, so that glimpses of the country could be seen
now and then.</p>

<p>The chase was now on in earnest. For some
time, however, the auto kept well in advance of
the horsemen, for Jerry used all the power possible
on the differential gear. If the high speed
one had been in working order there would have
been no question of the outcome, but, for once,
luck was against the boys.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer came the gang on horseback.
They got so close that their shouts to halt
could be plainly heard. But Jerry was not going
to give up. He gritted his teeth and gripped the
wheel with a firmer grasp.</p>

<p>“We seem to be slacking up,” observed Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s what we are,” spoke Jerry. “The
auto is going back on us.”</p>

<p>The car did seem to be dragging, and there was
no excuse for it in the condition of the road, which
was a fine level one.</p>

<p>“The car needs repairing,” said Jerry, “and
the way I have to run it isn’t the best thing in the
world for it.”</p>

<p>“Do you think they’ll catch up to us?” asked
Bob.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid so,” muttered Jerry. “We are
going the limit now.”</p>

<p>The thunder of the horses sounded nearer and
the shouts of the pursuing gang came more plainly
on the morning breeze. The auto coughed and
wheezed, seeming like a man who has run far and
is about to collapse. The explosions became less
frequent, and finally one of the cylinders ceased to
work altogether, leaving only three in commission.</p>

<p>“Now we’re in for it!” muttered Jerry, as,
by a hasty glance back he saw the men spurring
their horses on.</p>

<p>“You’d better give up!” one of the gang
shouted.</p>

<p>“Not yet, you scoundrels!” cried Jerry, as he
advanced the sparkling lever to the final notch.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
This seemed to be the last straw to the auto engine,
for with a dismal snort it stopped short.</p>

<p>“This settles it,” muttered Ned grimly. “We
are done for.”</p>

<p>Fortunately, however, they were on a slight
slope now, and the car, with the impetus it had
gathered, began to glide down the hill under its
own momentum.</p>

<p>But the horsemen were not one thousand feet
in the rear and were drawing nearer. There
seemed to be no help at hand and there was every
indication that the boys would fall into the hands
of their desperate enemies.</p>

<p>“How much farther can we go?” asked
Tommy suddenly.</p>

<p>“To the foot of the hill,” replied Jerry.
“Why do you ask?”</p>

<p>“That’s far enough!” exclaimed Tommy.
“I guess we can escape them.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Steer straight for that dead pine tree,” replied
the young lad, “and when you get almost
to it, make a wide turn to the right.”</p>

<p>“What good will that do?”</p>

<p>“There’s a big cave right at the foot of the
hill,” replied Tommy. “I know for I passed it
as I was tramping toward the ranch. It is large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
enough to take in the auto, and maybe we can hold
it against the gang.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” shouted Jerry, as he shifted the
wheel to conform with Tommy’s directions.
“We’ll beat ’em yet!”</p>

<p>Straight toward the dead pine Jerry aimed,
and, as he came to the bottom of the slope, he saw
an opening in the bush-lined side of the hill, that
told him the cave was at hand. Into it, by a skillful
turn, he steered the auto, and the machine,
running in about one hundred feet from the opening
came to a stop, just as the horsemen came
dashing up, much surprised by the sudden disappearance
of those they were pursuing.</p>

<p>“We’re safe!” whispered Ned.</p>

<p>“Not yet,” said Jerry. “We must arm ourselves,”
and he began to get out the rifles from
the bottom of the car, and hand them around to
his companions.</p>

<p>Outside the cavern, which was a natural one
in the rocky side of the hill, there came confused
shouts.</p>

<p>“Where did they go?” they heard a voice ask.</p>

<p>“Must have gone over some ledge and been
killed,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Then that settles it,” said the first one.
“That’s just our bad luck!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>Then came a curious cry, and, by it, the boys
knew their hiding place was discovered.</p>

<p>“Here are the tracks of the wheels!” the travelers
heard some one shout. “They turned off
somewhere about here.”</p>

<p>“Then they’re in that cave,” was the rejoinder.</p>

<p>“Dismount!” came a sharp order.</p>

<p>The boys could hear the men getting off their
horses, and the animals being led away.</p>

<p>“Get your carbines ready!” was the next command.</p>

<p>“It’s time for us to act!” whispered Jerry.
“We must each one take a gun, and stand at the
mouth of the cave. We’ll warn them not to enter.
If they persist we will have to fire, but we
must try not to hurt any one mortally. Aim at
their legs!”</p>

<p>In the half darkness of the cavern the boys and
the professor each took a rifle and crept to the
mouth of the opening. No sooner had they
reached it than they heard the tramp of feet, and
shadows told them the bad men were advancing.</p>

<p>“Halt!” cried Jerry, who had naturally assumed
command.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” asked the leader of the gang.</p>

<p>“Never mind who we are,” replied Jerry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
“We are in possession of this cave, and we warn
you not to come in!”</p>

<p>“Big words for a kid!” sneered the leader.</p>

<p>“You’ll find we can back them up,” spoke
Jerry. Then, in lower tones, he bade his comrades
stand in readiness.</p>

<p>There was a consultation in whispers among the
members of the gang, and then, seeming to feel
that they had nothing to fear, they made a rush.</p>

<p>“Fire!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>Remembering his instructions, the boys and the
professor aimed low. To the reports of the rifles
there succeeded howls of pain. Several of the
gang shot back, but, as it was dark in the cave they
could not see to aim, and they did no damage.</p>

<p>“Give them another volley!” yelled Jerry.</p>

<p>Again the rifles spoke, and this time, to the
chorus of howls there was added a command from
the leader to retreat, and the men rushed from the
cave, which was filled with smoke.</p>

<p>“Are&mdash;are any of them killed?” asked
Tommy.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe so,” replied Jerry. “We
fired too low to do much damage. I only wanted
to let them know we were ready for them.”</p>

<p>Waiting several minutes to see if there would
be any further attack, Jerry cautiously advanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
to the mouth of the cavern. In the semi-light he
saw several blood stains, but the absence of any
bodies told him the battle had not resulted fatally,
for which he was thankful. Though the men
were desperate characters, who, perhaps, would
not stop at murder, the boy did not want the responsibility
of killing any of them.</p>

<p>“They seem to have retreated,” Jerry reported
when he joined the others. “But I don’t
suppose they have gone for good. This probably
will only make them more anxious to get Tommy
away from us, for it is him they are after.”</p>

<p>“Do you think they want me?” asked the
younger lad.</p>

<p>“I am pretty sure, after what you have told us
about the mine, that they would give a good deal
to get you,” replied Jerry. “Perhaps your signature
may be as good as that of your father’s in
case&mdash;in case&mdash;” and Jerry stopped suddenly.</p>

<p>“You mean in case dad is dead?” asked
Tommy quietly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Jerry.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe my father is dead,” spoke the
boy bravely. “Somehow I feel that he is alive,
and that I will find him. But if the gang is after
me, it is not right for you all to be in danger on
my account. Give me up to them, I’m not afraid&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
is, I’ll try not to be. Let me go out and
surrender, and perhaps they’ll go away.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to see myself!” exclaimed Jerry.
“You don’t stir out of this cave, Tommy Bell,
until we go! I’m not afraid of that gang.
We’ve been in tighter places than this and gotten
out; haven’t we, fellows?”</p>

<p>“You bet!” echoed Bob and Ned.</p>

<p>“Then give me a gun and let me help fight,”
begged Tommy.</p>

<p>“Can you shoot?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“My father taught me,” was all Tommy said,
and Jerry gave him a rifle, at which Tommy’s eyes
sparkled.</p>

<p>A cautious glance from the mouth of the cave
showed that the gang had withdrawn some distance
away. But that they had no notion of giving
up the fight was evidenced by the fact that
they were constructing a camp so as to command
the entrance to the cavern.</p>

<p>“I guess they’re going to try and starve us
out,” remarked the professor. “Lucky we have
plenty of provisions and ammunition on hand for
a siege.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess we’re just as well off here as
anywhere,” observed Jerry. “We’d have to lay
up a few days at any rate, to fix the machine, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
it might as well be in a good roomy cave, where
the rain can’t wet us.”</p>

<p>The boys waited an hour before laying aside
their arms. Then, as the gang showed no signs
of renewing the attack, they proceeded to make
themselves more comfortable.</p>

<p>“Might as well get ready to camp out,” said
Ned. “I’ll set up the stove, and we’ll have
breakfast, though it is a little late.”</p>

<p>So while he set up the sheet iron apparatus,
Jerry instructed Bob to stand guard at the mouth
of the cavern, and to give instant notice of any activity
on the part of the enemy.</p>

<p>“But what will we do about eating breakfast?”
asked Bob in a sorrowful voice.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about that, ‘Chunky,’” said
Jerry. “I’ll relieve you, or some one will, in
time to get a meal. In the meantime keep a good
watch.”</p>

<p>Then Jerry went back to help Ned, and, at the
same time, make ready to repair the machine.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />
<small>ATTACKED BY A COUGAR</small></h2>


<p>“I say, Jerry,” called Ned, “we’re in a sort of
a pickle.”</p>

<p>“How’s that?”</p>

<p>“Why, I started to make coffee and I got along
all right until I came to the water.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“No, it’s not at all well. In fact we ought to
have a well here.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I mean there’s no water in the cave!”</p>

<p>“Great Scott! Is that so?” exclaimed Jerry.
“I never thought of such a thing. Are you sure
there’s not a spring away in the rear?”</p>

<p>“The professor and I made a good search,” replied
the temporary cook. “The cave comes to
an end about three hundred feet back, and there’s
not a sign of water.”</p>

<p>For a few seconds Jerry was silent. Then he
gave an exclamation.</p>

<p>“I have it!” he cried. “We can use the emergency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
water supply on the auto. It is not very
fresh, but it will do for coffee.”</p>

<p>“The very thing!” ejaculated Ned.</p>

<p>It was fortunate that the auto carried an extra
tank of water, as well as one of gasolene. They
had often found it useful in getting a supply of
the fluid for the radiator in places far from a supply,
and the reserve tank had been built with that
purpose in view. It held about ten gallons.
Drawing on this Ned had a supply for his coffee
which was soon boiling merrily on the stove, while
some canned chicken and bacon were put on to
fry.</p>

<p>“I say, is anybody going to relieve me?” called
Bob from his post on guard.</p>

<p>He smelled the breakfast in preparation, and it
added to his hunger.</p>

<p>“I’ll go,” volunteered the professor. “I’m in
no hurry to eat, and perhaps I may pick up a specimen
or two. This cave ought to be a good place
for them.”</p>

<p>Accordingly he took Bob’s place, and soon the
four boys were eating ravenously, and with as
good appetites as if a band of bad men was not
outside, ready to attack them at the first opportunity.</p>

<p>“Now to fix the machine,” said Jerry as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
rose from the ground that served as a table.
“Light all the lamps, Ned, and then you and Bob
come and help me. Tommy and the professor
can take turns standing guard.”</p>

<p>It was no easy matter to take the automobile
engine apart, and substitute a new gear for the
broken one. It was also found necessary to insert
new spark plugs, which had become covered
with a coating of carbon; and the cylinders also
needed cleaning, while the pistons had to be adjusted.</p>

<p>The afternoon was spent in working at the
auto, and by night such good progress had been
made that Jerry said by the next evening it would
be in shape to start.</p>

<p>“That is if the gang let’s us,” spoke Ned.</p>

<p>“We’ll make a dash for it,” replied Jerry.
“We needn’t fear them with the car in good order,
for we can leave them behind in less than half
an hour. We’ll try to escape to-morrow about
midnight.”</p>

<p>“In the meanwhile let’s eat,” suggested Bob,
and his cry brought forth the usual chaffing about
“Chunky’s” appetite.</p>

<p>Ned started to get supper. He went to the
tank of the auto to draw some water for the tea,
when he gave a cry of surprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s the trouble?” called Jerry.</p>

<p>“The water’s gone!” exclaimed Ned.
“That’s a leak in the tank!”</p>

<p>They all rushed to the car. There, on the
ground under the reserve tank was a muddy spot,
showing where the precious fluid had dripped
away. A quick examination showed there was a
small hole in the reservoir.</p>

<p>“Now we are up against it,” murmured Bob.</p>

<p>“Not quite yet,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“How can we get water without being shot?”
asked Ned.</p>

<p>“There is quite a bit left in the pipe coils of the
radiator,” answered Jerry. “It will be pretty poor
stuff to drink I guess, but it’s better than nothing.”</p>

<p>There was considerable of the fluid in the big
brass radiator on the front of the car, and, though
it was stale, and had been heated many times, as
it circulated about the cylinders, still, it was better
than none. Made into tea, which was served
as a change from coffee, it did not taste so very
bad.</p>

<p>But the situation was grave. With only water
enough on hand to last about half a day, the plight
of the travelers was a critical one.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to have water for the car, as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
as ourselves,” spoke Ned. “We can’t run the
machine without water.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” admitted Jerry dubiously.
“Something will have to be done.”</p>

<p>After the evening meal Jerry resumed his labors
on the car, working at double speed, in which he
was assisted by Ned and Bob. The professor and
Tommy took turns watching at the cavern’s mouth.</p>

<p>But there seemed to be no need of this, as the
men showed no inclination to make a second attack.
They appeared to know that the boys were
caught in a trap; a trap that contained no water.
So they evidently felt sure of success sooner or
later, and that without the danger of being
wounded.</p>

<p>Jerry and his comrades worked to such advantage
that shortly after midnight the auto was in
shape to be used, and with the new high gear
wheel in place. The car was given a good oiling,
and was repacked in readiness for a quick start.</p>

<p>“Now if we only had water,” sighed Jerry,
“we could slip out, and, I believe get away.”</p>

<p>But he knew it was useless to proceed without
at least a full radiator. The extra tank, which
had been repaired, could be filled later. The
radiator coils were empty however. What had
not been used for cooking had been made up into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
weak tea, as it was not considered healthful to
drink the water as it came from the pipes.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to do something,” said Jerry decidedly.
“If we stay here much longer we’ll die
of thirst. If we could only make a dash and get
some water we could manage. Two pails full
would do.”</p>

<p>“Let me go after them,” exclaimed Tommy.
“I’m not afraid. I can run fast. Maybe I can
get out there by the brook, get the water and come
back before any of them see me.”</p>

<p>“No you couldn’t,” spoke Jerry, pointing to
where one of the men, as sentry, could be seen,
from the mouth of the cave, walking up and down
near the camp fire. “If any one goes I will, and
I think I’d better start.”</p>

<p>Bob and Ned both offered to make the dangerous
attempt, and the professor insisted that he be
allowed to try, as he knew how to move over
ground very silently. But Jerry was firm in his
determination.</p>

<p>“I’m going to make the try about two o’clock,”
he said. “They’ll be sounder asleep then.”</p>

<p>As he was very tired he stretched out in some
blankets until it would be time to make the try.
He fell asleep soon, and the others moved away,
talking in whispers lest they disturb him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>Almost exactly at the appointed hour Jerry
awakened. He sat up, and, slipping a pair of
Indian moccasins over his shoes, to enable him to
move as silently as possible, he cautiously approached
the mouth of the cavern, carrying two
water pails with him.</p>

<p>The moon had gone down and it was quite
dark, which was favorable to Jerry’s plans. As
he got to the entrance of the cavern the boy looked
toward the gang’s camp. There seemed to be no
sign of life, and Jerry thought perhaps the sentry
had fallen asleep.</p>

<p>As silent as a cat the lad made his way toward
the stream, which he could hear gurgling and
splashing over the stones. His throat was dry,
for the last of the cold tea had been drunk, and
his exertions had made him very thirsty. As he
heard the sound of the brook he felt a fierce desire
for water, so strong was it that he felt he would
brave anything to get it.</p>

<p>Foot by foot he advanced, crouching down as
low as he could. He was beginning to feel that
he would be successful, and not be detected. He
could see the sparkle of the water about three
hundred feet away, and his parched mouth and
throat seemed to be as dry as leather. He could
hardly swallow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>On and on he went. Now he was about two
hundred feet away and he was getting ready to
make a dash for the brook.</p>

<p>Suddenly he heard a clicking sound, and knew
it was a rifle being cocked. Next there rang out
on the night air the command:</p>

<p>“Halt or I’ll fire!”</p>

<p>Poor Jerry was detected! He came to a stop,
sick at heart at the failure of his plan.</p>

<p>For a moment there was no other sound. The
boy could not see who had discovered him, though
he instinctively felt the eyes of the man on him.
Suddenly there was a shaking in the tree somewhat
to Jerry’s left, and about one hundred feet away.
Then came a rustle of the leaves on the ground and
the boy made out the figure of a man, dimly, standing
with rifle aimed straight at him.</p>

<p>“Throw up your hands!” was the next order,
and, letting the pails fall to the ground, Jerry
obeyed.</p>

<p>Then, all at once, there burst out on the air a
most terrifying sound. It was a blood-curdling
yell, a screech as if from some one in mortal
agony. Jerry felt the cold chills go down his back.</p>

<p>The next instant there was a crashing sound,
and, from the tree under which the man stood who
had aimed at the boy a dark body shot downward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>The screech of the cougar, for such it was,
mingled with the terrific yells of the sentry. Jerry
dimly saw a confused tangle of man and beast.
He heard the man shout for help. He heard his
rifle go off, and then came sounds that told that
the camp had been aroused.</p>

<p>The attack of the cougar had come just in time.
Jerry, taking advantage of the diversion, grabbed
up his pails, and running to the brook filled them
with water. Then, as fast as he could go, he ran
toward the cave.</p>

<small>A RUNAWAY AUTO</small></h2>


<p>Behind the boys sounded the yells and shouts
of the men in camp, mingled with rifle shots and
the screeching of several of the cougars, for, it
developed, a band of three, grown desperate by
hunger, had made an attack.</p>

<p>“Are you hurt, Jerry?” cried Bob and Ned,
as, with his pails of water, the boy staggered into
the cave.</p>

<p>“Not a bit, but I had a close shave,” was the
answer. “But we must be quick! Here! Help
fill the radiator with the water.”</p>

<p>“Can’t we drink any?” asked Bob who, like
the others, was very thirsty.</p>

<p>“Not a drop,” said Jerry firmly. “We need
every bit for the automobile. Without it we can’t
get away from here, and now is the only chance
we may have to escape. We can drink later.”</p>

<p>While Jerry and Ned filled the radiator the other
boys and the professor made ready for the escape.
Everything was packed up and placed in the car,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
which, as soon as the coil was filled, would be
ready to start and dash from the cave.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid this is not going to be water
enough,” spoke Jerry as the second of the pails
was emptied into the radiator.</p>

<p>“Can’t I make a dash for some more? There
seems to be excitement enough in the camp to keep
them from watching me,” said Ned. “I’m going
to try.”</p>

<p>There was considerable activity among the ranch
men. The cougars, though wounded, seemed to
have temporarily lost all fear and made attack after
attack on the men, who had to fire several volleys
from their rifles.</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” said Jerry. “I’ll start the engine
slowly.”</p>

<p>Grabbing up the pails Ned walked from the
cave.</p>

<p>“I’m going to help, also,” said Tommy.</p>

<p>“No, you stay here,” commanded Jerry. “Bob
can go if he wants to.”</p>

<p>Bob joined Ned. They ran to the stream and
had filled the pails when, just as they started on
the way back, the wounded cougars, driven from
the camp, came dashing after the boys.</p>

<p>“Now we’re in for it!” exclaimed Ned. “Run,
Bob!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>And run they did, as they had never run before,
and left the beasts behind.</p>

<p>“Have you the water?” asked Jerry eagerly as
the boys came in.</p>

<p>“We have!” exclaimed Bob. “And hard
enough work we had getting it.”</p>

<p>“Good!”</p>

<p>Jerry hurriedly poured most of it into the radiator,
though every one in the cave looked at the
fluid with longing eyes.</p>

<p>“I must get a drink soon, or I shall go half
crazy!” said the professor suddenly. “I never
was so thirsty in my life.”</p>

<p>“I’m saving just a little bit for each of us,”
spoke Jerry. “But it is a very small quantity,
and will only serve to wet our mouths. If all goes
well we shall soon have plenty.”</p>

<p>He distributed about a pint of the water among
his companions, and though each one got only a
little it brought welcome relief.</p>

<p>“Now we’re ready to skip out!” announced
Jerry as he screwed the cap on the radiator tank,
and increased the speed of the engine. “But first
we had better take a look outside to see if any of
that gang are in sight.”</p>

<p>The professor, who had good eyes, went to the
mouth of the cave, and, coming back, reported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
that he could see a dark mass moving on the further
bank of the stream.</p>

<p>“They have evidently gotten over their scare
about the cougars,” Mr. Snodgrass said, “and are
waiting to bag us. What are we going to do?”</p>

<p>“There’s only one thing to do,” replied Jerry.</p>

<p>“And that is what?”</p>

<p>“We must make a dash for it. The road is
fairly good, and I guess we can speed up enough
to get out of the range of their bullets in a short
time. They can’t be very good shots or they
would have killed the three cougars, with all the
bullets they fired.”</p>

<p>So it was decided. They all took their places
in the car, and Jerry, who, as if by mutual consent,
assumed the place of steersman, leaned forward
to throw in the gear clutches.</p>

<p>“Here we go!” he cried. “Look out everybody!”</p>

<p>Slowly at first, but gathering speed, the auto
moved out of the cave. The lamps lighted up the
path, and, though the boys realized that the lanterns
disclosed their position to their enemies, they
had to use them for their own safety. It was too
dark to do without them.</p>

<p>A few seconds later and the car emerged from
the cavern. As it shot out there came a chorus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
of angry cries from the camp of the ranchmen,
and several shots were fired, though none of them
came close enough to be uncomfortable.</p>

<p>“Here we go!” cried Jerry again, as he increased
the speed, and the auto fairly leaped forward.
It swayed from side to side, and struck
several ruts, so that the occupants were tossed
about.</p>

<p>But the main thing was that they went ahead,
and away from their enemies. Jerry, peering as
best he could into the darkness ahead, made a
course for the stream, intending to go close to it,
and then run along the bank, or near it, as he had
noted in the afternoon that there was a fairly good
road there.</p>

<p>Gradually the shouts of the men, and the firing
of their guns died away, and the travelers began
to breathe more freely. They had made their escape,
and, for the present, were safe.</p>

<p>“Oh do let’s stop and get a drink!” pleaded
Bob.</p>

<p>“Not yet!” exclaimed Jerry. “Five minutes
more will not kill you, and it may save all our
lives,” for he did not want to slack up while there
was any danger of the ranchmen coming after
them.</p>

<p>The five minutes seemed like an hour to Bob,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
and the others, too, were impatient. But at last
Jerry shut off the power and the machine came to
a halt not far from the creek. Out scrambled the
boys and the professor, and then, in spite of the
danger of drinking snakes and lizards in the darkness,
they all made for the stream, where they
quenched their thirst from small collapsable cups
which each one had been holding in readiness for
just that chance.</p>

<p>“That’s better than an ice cream soda!” exclaimed
Ned.</p>

<p>“You bet!” agreed Bob heartily. “I never
tasted such fine water.”</p>

<p>“Very good!” said the professor.</p>

<p>“I guess we can stop long enough to lay in a
supply now,” remarked Jerry. “We can start off
again in five minutes, and in that time they can not
catch up to us.”</p>

<p>So the radiator was filled to the top, and the
auxiliary tank likewise, while the boys indulged
freely in the liquid, thinking, perhaps, they might
have some of the characteristics of the camel, and
could drink enough at one time to last a week or
more.</p>

<p>Then they started forward again, and the auto
soon carried them beyond the possibility of capture
that night. They camped out in the open,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
and, in spite of their rather exciting adventures
they slept soundly, awaking as the sun rose.</p>

<p>Ned was given a chance to run the machine, and
he took the front seat with Tommy, who was delighted
to be there for the first time. They had
not been going long before they found the land
was rising.</p>

<p>“We’re coming into the mountains now,” said
Jerry.</p>

<p>Up a long hill, with a gradual assent, puffed the
auto. On either side were broad fields where tall
Pampas grass was growing, amid which thousands
of grasshoppers, or some similar insect, were singing.</p>

<p>“Better be sure your brake is in good working
order,” suggested Jerry, as they came to the steep
descent on the other side. “We don’t want any
more accidents.”</p>

<p>Ned tried the ordinary brake. There was a
clicking sound, followed by a snapping one.</p>

<p>“Brake’s busted!” exclaimed Jerry. “Try the
emergency!”</p>

<p>Ned did so. That, too, gave out only a faint
screech, and did not grip the axle as it should.</p>

<p>“Look out now!” yelled Jerry. “We’re in
for it!”</p>

<p>An instant later the auto began to move forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
at a rapid pace. All Ned’s efforts to check it
were in vain.</p>

<p>“We’re running away!” cried frightened
Tommy. “I wish I’d stayed in back!”</p>

<p>“Keep to the middle of the road!” Jerry cried
above the noise of the auto rushing down the steep
hill. At the bottom the road took a sharp turn,
and the hearts of all beat rapidly with fear as they
beheld it.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br />
<small>TOMMY FINDS A FRIEND</small></h2>


<p>So rapidly did the machine shoot down the descent
that it almost seemed the curved road was
rushing to meet the travelers. Again and again
Ned tried the brakes, but without avail. He had
shut off the power at the first indication that something
was wrong.</p>

<p>“We can never make that turn!” exclaimed
Bob.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not,” agreed Jerry.</p>

<p>They were all clinging to the sides of the car,
while Ned gripped the steering wheel with a desperate
hold.</p>

<p>“Look out for the turn!” cried the professor as
they came to the sharp curve.</p>

<p>But, to the surprise of all, Ned, instead of shifting
the wheel in at least an attempt to swing around
the half circle kept straight on the course. The
boy had resolved on another plan.</p>

<p>Directly in front of him, and to the left of the
road was a big field of tall waving Pampas grass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the plumes nodding eight feet above the ground.
It was shut off from the thoroughfare by a frail
wooden fence.</p>

<p>“I’m going to steer into the grass!” cried Ned.
“It’s our only chance!”</p>

<p>The next instant there was a splintering sound
as the auto crashed through the fence, which offered
no more resistance, because of the great
speed, than a paper hoop does to a circus performer.
Then it seemed to the travelers as though
they had been plunged into a tossing, waving sea
of grass.</p>

<p>The tall Pampas plumes and the stems wrapped
themselves about the boys and the professor, almost
choking them by the pollen that was shaken
off. The feathery-like tops tickled them in the
eyes, nose and mouth as, carried by the runaway
auto, they were dashed through them.</p>

<p>But the grass had just the effect Ned had intended
and hoped for. It clogged the wheels of
the machine, and though soft, offered so much resistance
that the machine soon began to slow down,
as does a locomotive when it runs into a snow
drift.</p>

<p>After plowing through the field for about two
hundred feet the car came to a final stop, with a
little jolt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>“Santa Maria! Caramba!” yelled a voice and
then followed such a string of Spanish that the
boys thought they had run down a whole camp
of Mexican herders.</p>

<p>“Did we hit any one?” asked Jerry, peering
forward as well as he could through the tall grass.</p>

<p>“Caramba! Hit any one! The Americano
pirates have killed Don Elvardo!” exclaimed the
unseen one. “You have broken&mdash;!” and then
followed such a confusion of words that the boys
could not understand.</p>

<p>“Have we broken your leg?” asked Jerry,
speaking in Spanish this time.</p>

<p>“Santa Maria! No! You have broken the
cigarette I just rolled!” and with that the grass
parted in front of the auto, and a little Mexican,
wearing a suit profusely trimmed with silver braid,
showed himself.</p>

<p>The boys felt like laughing as they beheld the
woe-begone face of Don Elvardo. In his hand
he held the remains of a cigarette.</p>

<p>“Behold!” he went on tragically. “I am
peacefully walking in my field, looking over my
crop of Pampas, when I feel a desire to smoke.
I sit me down and roll a cigarette. I am about
to light it, when&mdash;Santa Maria! There is a
rushing sound of ten thousand imps of darkness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
My grass is mowed down as if by a sickle in the
hands of a giant. I turn in fear! I see something
coming! I can not tell what it is, for the
tall grass hides it! I turn to flee! The infernal
thing keeps after me! Presto! Caramba! It
hits me so&mdash;”</p>

<p>Don Elvardo illustrated by slapping himself
vigorously on the thigh.</p>

<p>“Then I fall! I am crushed! I am killed!
I die in pain and fear! I arise! Behold, senor
Americanos, my cigarette is broken!”</p>

<p>“We’re very sorry, of course,” said Jerry politely.
“But you see our auto ran away on the
hill, and as the brakes would not work, the only
thing to save our lives was to steer into this field.
We did not know you were here, or we would have
sent around to your house to ask permission to
enter,” added the lad sarcastically.</p>

<p>“But I am here!” snapped the Mexican.</p>

<p>“So we see,” admitted Jerry. “We are willing
to pay for any damage we have done.”</p>

<p>The Mexican’s eyes sparkled, and he rubbed his
hands as if in anticipation.</p>

<p>“That alters the case,” said Don Elvardo.
“The Americano senors are welcome ten thousand
times to my field. I bid you welcome. I salute
you. Pay. Oh, yes! It is but right that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
should pay!” Again he rubbed his hands together.</p>

<p>“About what would you say it was worth?”
asked Ned.</p>

<p>“I am no miser,” replied the Mexican. “I do
not wish to insult my friends the Americanos. I
will only charge them for the damage to the grass.
The broken fence is of no moment. Pay me one
hundred dollars and I will say no more about the
affair.”</p>

<p>“He’s a robber!” said Jerry in a low voice.
“We haven’t done five dollars’ damage to his crop
and the fence combined.”</p>

<p>“I guess he will whistle for his one hundred dollars,”
said Ned.</p>

<p>Don Elvardo heard him.</p>

<p>“So!” he exclaimed. “You will not pay me
one little hundred dollars for the damage. Caramba!
Then it is I who shall at once lodge a
complaint with the authorities. We will see if
there is a law in the land, or if crazy Americanos
can spoil a poor man’s crop and pay nothing. We
shall see!”</p>

<p>“Offer him ten dollars,” suggested Bob. The
boys consulted together a minute or two. They
wanted to be fair, but they did not care to be
robbed. The professor had taken no part in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
discussion. He seemed to be intently examining
the tall grass on either side of the machine.</p>

<p>Suddenly the scientist stepped from the side of
the car, and rapidly made his way to the front,
where Don Elvardo stood. Mr. Snodgrass gazed
intently at the Mexican. Then he gave a leap
toward the Don, exclaiming as he did so:</p>

<p>“There it is! Right on your hat! Don’t
move an inch or it will jump away! I have it
now! This is indeed a lucky day! Just a second
and I’ll have it!”</p>

<p>With that the professor made a leap toward the
Mexican with outstretched hands.</p>

<p>“Santa Maria! Diavolo?” screamed Don Elvardo
as he saw the scientist coming for him.
“Caramba! It is to murder me that you come!”</p>

<p>Then, calling for help at the top of his voice,
the Mexican turned and fled in terror, his course
being marked through the tall grass by the wave-like
motion he imparted to the plumes in his haste.</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;why what in the world ails him?”
asked Mr. Snodgrass.</p>

<p>“He probably thought you were going to choke
him to death,” said Jerry with a laugh. “In fact
your actions were not so very far from giving that
idea.”</p>

<p>“Why bless my soul!” ejaculated the professor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
“All I wanted was to get a fine specimen of a blue
grasshopper from his big hat, where the insect had
alighted. It was worth about forty dollars.”</p>

<p>“I saw some just as good in a city once for
twenty dollars,” put in Tommy, “and they had
more silver braid on.”</p>

<p>“What! A grasshopper with silver braid
on?” cried the scientist.</p>

<p>“I thought you said his hat was worth forty
dollars,” went on Tommy, somewhat embarrassed.</p>

<p>“I was speaking of the blue grasshopper,” explained
Mr. Snodgrass. “My, I am sorry to have
missed that one.”</p>

<p>“But you did a good service in scaring this
Mexican away, as you did the chap with the ox
cart,” spoke Ned. “He might have made trouble
for us.”</p>

<p>“And we had better get out of here while we
have the chance,” said Jerry. “He may come
back any minute.”</p>

<p>Accordingly the auto was turned around, and
run over the same course by which it had entered
the field. Otherwise it would have been almost
impossible to have advanced, so thick was the grass.
The road regained, the machine was sent along it
at good speed, for fear Don Elvardo or some of
his friends might appear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>“We had better stop and fix the brakes,” suggested
Ned, after an hour’s run.</p>

<p>“And get dinner at the same time,” put in Bob.
“We’ll kill two stones with the same automobile,
as the poem says.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’re a little twisted,” remarked Ned,
“but your intentions are good.”</p>

<p>A halt was made under a big tree, near a little
stream, and soon a good fire was built and dinner
was being cooked.</p>

<p>It was found that some nuts had become loose
on the brakes, and this trouble Jerry soon remedied.
After the meal they sat about and talked a while.</p>

<p>“We’ll soon be in New Mexico,” remarked
Jerry, consulting a small map.</p>

<p>“Will we?” asked Tommy. “I’m so glad.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because there’s a man who was once a friend
of my father at a place called Las Cruces. It’s
near the Rio Grande river. If we could go there
I know Mr. Douglass would take care of me.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll go there,” said Jerry. “It will
be right on our route.”</p>

<p>They all agreed this would be a good plan.
That night the travelers stopped in a small village
where they had good beds and meals. They resumed
the journey next day, and for several days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
thereafter met with no mishaps as they speeded
toward Las Cruces. They had left the lowlands
and were well up among the hills by this time.</p>

<p>One day, just at dusk, they rolled into Las
Cruces and, after a little inquiry found Mr. Douglass,
who was very glad to see Tommy.</p>

<p>“I will be glad to take care of him for the
present,” he said.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a><br />
<small>THE COLORED MAN’S GHOST</small></h2>


<p>The travelers found the town where Tommy’s
friend lived such a pleasant place that they spent
several days there. It was a thriving place, and
the auto was a source of endless wonder to most
of the inhabitants, who had never seen one.</p>

<p>Had the boys wished they could have made considerable
money taking parties out in the car for
short trips, but they knew they had a long journey
before them and they wished to save the machine
all they could. It needed some repairs which were
made by the local blacksmith, and then the travelers
were ready to move forward again.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how to thank you for all you did
for me,” said Tommy, as the boys were leaving.
“You saved my life. Maybe I will have a chance
to do you a good turn some day. If I have, you
can bet I’ll do it.”</p>

<p>“We know you will, Tommy,” said Jerry.
“Well, good-by. I hope we see you again.”</p>

<p>“Same here!” exclaimed Bob and Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>They did not know how soon they were to meet
their friend again, nor in what a peculiar manner he
was able to aid them in return for what they had
done for him.</p>

<p>For several days the auto skimmed along
through a somewhat lonely country. The roads
were not very good and a number of times progress
was so slow that only a few miles were made
between sunrise and sunset. Now and then the
travelers would come to a lonely cabin, where they
could replenish their food supply or get a night’s
lodging. But, in the main, they had to depend on
their own resources.</p>

<p>Occasionally they would reach a little settlement,
where their arrival never failed to produce
as much excitement as a fire and circus combined.
Every day brought them nearer their gold mine,
concerning which they were very anxious, as they
had heard nothing further from Jim Nestor.</p>

<p>“The mine may have been taken away from him
for all we know,” chafed Jerry as he fretted at
the delay caused by bad roads.</p>

<p>“We’ll hope for the best,” said Ned. “No use
crossing a bridge until you come to it.”</p>

<p>The travelers were well up among the lower
mountains now, though compared with the heights
they had still to scale the range was one of mere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
hills. One evening just at dusk, after a particularly
hard day of travel, during which the auto
had broken down several times, necessitating minor
repairs, the Motor Boys came to a place where two
roads divided.</p>

<p>“I wonder which we had better take?” asked
Bob, who was at the wheel.</p>

<p>“The right,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“The left,” advised Ned.</p>

<p>“Toss up a cent,” suggested the professor.
“Make it heads right and tails left.”</p>

<p>They did so. The coin came down heads up,
and Bob turned the machine to the right. It had
not proceeded far on this road when, about a mile
ahead, the travelers saw a couple of log cabins.</p>

<p>“Well, there’s shelter for to-night, at all
events,” Jerry remarked, “and, I hope, supper as
well. I’m getting a little tired of bacon and
coffee.”</p>

<p>They found one of the cabins occupied by a negro,
his wife, and seven children, the oldest a boy
of sixteen and the youngest a little girl, just able
to toddle.</p>

<p>“Good evening,” greeted the professor, “can
we get supper and lodging anywhere about here?”</p>

<p>“I reckon I kin fix yo’ up on th’ eatin’ question,
boss,” remarked the darkey as he stood in the cabin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
door as the auto drew up, “but I ’clare t’ goodness
I can’t find no room t’ stable that there rip-snortin’
beast ye got.”</p>

<p>“We don’t expect you to take the auto in,” spoke
Jerry. “If you give us beds for ourselves, or
even a room to sleep in we’ll pay for it and glad
to do it.”</p>

<p>“Land sakes, I’d like t’ ’blige yo’, deed ’n I
would boss,” went on the negro, “but my cabin
am jest crowded t’ th’ doah wif me an’ my fambily.
Yo’ am welcome t’ suthin’ t’ eat, but land a’ massy
whar I’se goin’ t’ have yo’ sleep hab got me cogitatin’.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with that other cabin?”
asked Ned.</p>

<p>“What other cabin?” asked the negro, not turning
to look in the direction of the second shack,
about a quarter of a mile down the road.</p>

<p>“That one,” went on Ned, pointing to it.
“There may be room in it.”</p>

<p>“Oh I reckon there’s room enough,” replied the
colored man, “only&mdash;well to tell you th’ truff,
boss, it ain’t exackly healthy t’ sleep in that cabin,
er even t’ talk about it. ’Scuse me but I don’t
want even t’ look at it.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>The colored man seemed to hesitate. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
fidgeted and seemed ready to go back into his
house.</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Ned again.</p>

<p>“Kase it’s&mdash;it’s got ghosts an’ it’s hanted!”
exclaimed the negro, “an’ it ain’t safe fer any one
to go near it, let alone sleep in it.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” remarked the professor. “There
are no such things as ghosts.”</p>

<p>“Yo’ wouldn’t say so if yo’ went to that there
cabin after dark,” persisted the colored man.
“’Tain’t safe t’ talk about it, so yo’ll please ’scuse
me.”</p>

<p>“But what sort of a ghost is it?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“It’s big an’ it’s white, an’ it rattles chains an’
groans sumthin’ turrible,” said the negro.</p>

<p>“Did you ever see it?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Did I ever see it, boss? Couse I done see it.
Only t’other night it near skeered me to deff.”</p>

<p>“How long has it been there?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“’Bout a week I reckon,” replied the negro.
“Ever since Rastus Johnson moved away from th’
cabin.”</p>

<p>“I guess we’ll take a chance with the ghost for
the sake of spending a night under shelter,” said
Jerry. “Meanwhile we can get supper here.”</p>

<p>And a fine supper they had. Mrs. Jones, wife
of the colored man, proved an excellent cook. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
fried some chicken, made some corn bread, and
that, with preserves and some good coffee, made up
a meal which the travelers voted one of the finest
they had eaten in many months.</p>

<p>“Can we get breakfast here, also?” asked Jerry
when supper was finished.</p>

<p>“If yo’ am alive,” replied Jones solemnly.</p>

<p>“If we’re alive? What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Well I reckon ef yo’ sleeps in that hanted
cabin, there won’t be any of yo’ left t’ want a meal
in th’ mo’nin’,” explained Jones. “It’s takin’
yo’uns’ lives in yo’ hands t’ go nigh it suah yo’ is
boahn!”</p>

<p>All they could say did not induce the man to
change his mind. He was plainly afraid of the
cabin and the “ghost.”</p>

<p>But the travelers were determined not to let a
little thing like that interfere with a chance to sleep
under shelter. Accordingly they covered the auto
with the tarpaulin provided for that purpose, and
moved their blankets into the deserted cabin, which
was fairly clean and in good condition. One of
the big oil lamps gave sufficient light.</p>

<p>The cabin contained only two rooms, one on
the ground floor, and the other above it, reached
by a movable ladder.</p>

<p>“I think we had better sleep upstairs,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Jerry. “The door doesn’t fasten very securely,
and besides I think it will be drier there.”</p>

<p>So they mounted the ladder, spread their blankets
out on the floor, and were all soon fast asleep.
None of them expected to be disturbed, for they
laid the story of the ghost to an overwrought imagination
of the colored man.</p>

<p>So it was with a sudden feeling of terror that
Jerry was awakened in the middle of the night by
hearing a deep groan, seeming to come from the
room below.</p>

<p>He sat up, rubbing his eyes to further awaken
himself, and then he became aware that Bob was
also sitting up. He could see because of the moonlight
streaming in through a window.</p>

<p>“Did you hear anything?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“I thought so,” answered Bob.</p>

<p>“I thought I did,” put in Ned, who, it seems
had been awakened at the same time the others
were.</p>

<p>Once more there sounded an unmistakable groan.
It came from the ground floor, and was so loud,
penetrating and, in spite of the would-be bravery of
the boys, so awful coming out of the darkness, that
they shuddered.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked the professor, who also,
this time, was roused from his slumbers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>Before either of the boys could answer the groan
was repeated and this time it was followed by the
unmistakable clanking of chains.</p>

<p>“The colored man’s ghost!” whispered Bob.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” exclaimed the professor, but, no
sooner had he spoken than there came another
weird noise, and the chains rattled louder than
ever.</p>

<p>“Light the lantern,” whispered Jerry. “We
must see what it is. Perhaps it’s only some one
playing a joke.”</p>

<p>“Let me take a look before you make a light,”
suggested the professor. “I can look down the
ladder hole.”</p>

<p>Softly he crawled over to the opening and peered
down. As he did so the noises were repeated.
The professor uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>“It bears the other descriptive marks of the
creature the negro told about,” he said, crawling
back to where the boys were huddled together.
“It is big and white and it seems to be trying to
climb up the ladder.”</p>

<p>“Wait until I get my revolver,” whispered
Jerry. “We’ll soon see if it’s a ghost or not.”</p>

<p>“Don’t fire,” cautioned the professor. “It
may be some one trying to scare us, but we have
no right to fire at any one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll give ’em a warning, at any rate,” said the
lad. He went to the opening and called down:</p>

<p>“Tell us who you are or I’ll shoot, do you
hear?”</p>

<p>A groan and the clanking of chains was the only
answer. This was followed by a violent agitation
and shaking of the ladder.</p>

<p>“Bang!” went Jerry’s revolver. He had fired
into the air.</p>

<p>Succeeding the report there was a silence. This
was broken by a further clanking of chains. Then
came a crash, and when the echo of this died away
the sound of feet running away could be heard.</p>

<p>“Pretty solid footsteps for a ghost,” commented
Ned.</p>

<p>“Look! Look!” cried Bob, pointing out of
the window.</p>

<p>There, running down the moon-lit road the boys
saw a big white mule, to the neck of which was
fastened a chain that rattled with every step.</p>

<p>“There’s the ghost,” said the professor. “I
thought I recognized the voice as that of a quadruped
with which I was familiar. The animal has
probably broken loose from the field and came here
in search of food.”</p>

<p>“Well it certainly scared me all right,” admitted
Bob. The others did not commit themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
but there was no doubt but that they had
several heart-flutters.</p>

<p>“I wonder what that crash was?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>The professor glanced down the hole leading to
the first floor.</p>

<p>“The ghost made it by kicking our ladder
away,” the scientist replied. “I wonder how we
can get down.”</p>

<p>But the boys did not worry about this, being too
sleepy. Soon they were all snoring again, and
did not awaken until the sun was streaming in the
window.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a><br />
<small>TROUBLE WITH A BAD MAN</small></h2>


<p>“This is a nice pickle!” exclaimed Bob, who
was the first to rise.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, lost your collar button?”
sleepily inquired Jerry.</p>

<p>“No, but the mule knocked the ladder down,
and we’ll have to jump or stay here.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t far to the ground in this shanty,” remarked
Jerry. “Go ahead and drop down.”</p>

<p>“It may not be very far,” said Bob, “but I
don’t want to take the chance.”</p>

<p>“Afraid you’ll sprain your ankle?”</p>

<p>“No, but I don’t want to fall into the cistern.”</p>

<p>“Cistern? What are you talking about?”</p>

<p>“Well,” went on Bob, “there’s a cistern right
under this ladder opening. The mule pulled the
cover off last night, and whoever drops down is
going to land goodness knows where.”</p>

<p>The others soon confirmed what Bob had said.
When the cabin was built a cistern had been sunk
in the middle of the ground floor. This had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
covered, and the ladder rested on it when the
travelers went to bed, but the mule, probably in
search for a drink, uncovered it.</p>

<p>“Can’t get down without a ladder,” observed
Ned.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with jumping from one of
the outside windows?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>They thought the idea a good one until they saw
that the only one there was opened onto a pile of
sharp rocks, into which even a jump of fifteen
feet might be dangerous.</p>

<p>“What’s to be done?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Guess we’ll have to wait until Jones comes to
see if we are dead,” replied Jerry. “Then he
can cover the cistern and raise the ladder.”</p>

<p>“I guess we’ll have a long wait for Jones,” commented
Ned. “He’s so afraid of this place that
he’ll never come within hearing distance of it.”</p>

<p>“Let’s yell out of the window,” suggested Bob.</p>

<p>They did so, uniting their voices in a volume
of sound. It seemed to have no effect though, for
there was no movement about the colored man’s
cabin.</p>

<p>“Once more,” urged the professor.</p>

<p>This time they produced a result, for, down
the road they could see Jones come to the door of
his shack and peer out. Thereupon they waved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
their hands to him, and in a few minutes the
colored man was standing as close as he seemed
to dare to come to their shelter.</p>

<p>“Is yo’ all daid?” he asked in awed accents.</p>

<p>“Not quite all of us,” answered the professor,
“but we will be unless you come in and hoist the
ladder for us.”</p>

<p>“Did th’&mdash;th’ ghost knock it down?” asked
Jones.</p>

<p>“It did,” replied Bob, solemnly.</p>

<p>“I knowed it! I knowed it! Maybe you’ll
believe me next time. Golly! I ain’t goin’ t’ stay
here,” and Jones was about to run off down the
road.</p>

<p>“Here! Come back!” commanded the captives,
and the colored man reluctantly did so.</p>

<p>“I doan laik t’ stay round yeah!” pleaded the
negro. “’Tain’t no ways healthy. What yo’
done want, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“We want you to hoist the ladder for us,” said
the professor. “Come now, don’t be silly. The
only ghost there was, and we saw it, was an old
white mule with a chain on its neck.”</p>

<p>“Co’se it were! Dat’s de form it took when I
seed it!” cried Jones. “But it can take on any
shape, dat ghost can. Next time it’ll be a lion er
a tiger er a elephant. Monstrous terrible things,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
ha’nts is. So de ghost done knocked de ladder
down! I knowed it would do suthin’.”</p>

<p>Amid a show of genuine fear the colored man
entered the cabin, and after replacing the cistern
cover cautiously raised the ladder. Then he ran
out as if the ghost were after him.</p>

<p>“I guess we’ll never be able to convince Jones
that there isn’t a ghost here,” said Jerry as they
came down and started down the road toward the
colored man’s cabin, where they were to have breakfast.</p>

<p>“Here’s something that may prove to him that
the mule was the ghost,” spoke Ned, picking up a
horse shoe, which was on the cabin floor.</p>

<p>They showed it to the negro, but he only shook
his head.</p>

<p>“It looks like a hoss shoe, dat I admit,” said
Jones, “but it’s enchanted. It’ll turn inter a snake
er a tiger er suthin’ terruble ’fore long. I don’t
want nothin’ t’ do with it,” and he cast it into the
bushes by the side of the road.</p>

<p>The excitement of the night had taken none of
the travelers’ appetites away, and they made a good
meal. Then, once more they took the road, disappearing
in a cloud of dust, while Jones, his wife,
and the seven children stood and stared in wonder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>They traveled all that day with only an occasional
glimpse of civilization in the shape of some
house or cabin. No villages were reached, it being
a centre of vast grazing lands, where only a
lonely herder, or, perhaps two, remained to guard
the cattle. That night they camped in the open,
and found it rather uncomfortable, for it began to
rain about midnight.</p>

<p>“I wish we were back in the cabin, with the
ghost-mule and everything else,” muttered Jerry,
as he tried to find a dry spot to lie down on.</p>

<p>But troubles can not last forever, and morning
came finally, bringing a clear day and a bright sun
which was very welcome.</p>

<p>Breakfast over they took the road once more.
About noon they came to a small town that boasted
of what was called the “Imperial Hotel.”</p>

<p>“I suppose we’d better try the Imperial,” suggested
Ned. “It don’t look very scrumptious,
but you can’t always tell by the appearance of a
toad how far he can jump.”</p>

<p>The auto drew up in front of the inn with a
noise that brought a score of men from the barroom.</p>

<p>“Jumpin’ Gila Monsters and rattlesnakes!”
cried one of the men, evidently a miner from his
dress. “I’ve read about them Satan go-carts, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
I never believed in ’em. Sakes alive, but they do
look funny without a hoss in front.”</p>

<p>He and the others gathered about the car, asking
so many questions that it took all the boys and
the professor as well to answer them. When
curiosity had been partially satisfied the boys went
into the hotel. While there was nothing to make
a weary traveler glad he had found it, the place
was not as bad as many where the Motor Boys
had stopped. They had a good meal, and decided
to rest a few hours before proceeding.</p>

<p>It was along about three o’clock. The crowd of
men in the barroom had become larger as new
comers arrived. It was also noisier and loud
voices, and occasional threats to shoot, made the
travelers think it was about time to move on.</p>

<p>They were about to go to their machine when
they were approached on the porch where they
were sitting, by the miner who had first remarked
about the auto. He had evidently been drinking
more than was good for him, and was in a quarrelsome
mood.</p>

<p>“If you don’t want to play with me you
needn’t,” he called, evidently to some one inside.
“I can find some one to shuffle the cards with me.
Here, you kid”&mdash;to Jerry, “you come an’ we’ll
have a little game.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thank you, I don’t play,” said Jerry quietly.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” came the sharp return.</p>

<p>“I said I didn’t play.”</p>

<p>“Why hang my buttons! You got to play when
I tell you to,” cried the miner. “Pete Simmons
ain’t used to bein’ told no. Here, sit down to
this table an’ deal the cards,” and he grabbed Jerry
by the arm, and attempted to force him into a
chair.</p>

<p>“Let go my arm!” exclaimed Jerry.</p>

<p>“You do as I tell you or I’ll make you!” exclaimed
the brute. “I’m used to havin’ my way!”</p>

<p>“Take your hand off!” commanded Jerry,
drawing back his fist, for he was strong and hot
tempered.</p>

<p>“Now be nice, be nice!” sneered the man.</p>

<p>“Let go of him!” exclaimed Ned coming forward
and standing beside his chum, while Bob also
ranged up alongside. “We’ll all take a hand in
this if you force us to.”</p>

<p>“I can tackle the three of you with both hands
tied behind my back,” cried the miner, flushing
with anger at being defied by the boys.</p>

<p>“Count me in too,” spoke Professor Snodgrass,
joining the lads. “I don’t want to fight, but I will
if I have to.”</p>

<p>Now the professor, though a mild man, was, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
reason of his out-of-door life, in fine physical condition,
and no mean antagonist, which fact the
miner saw.</p>

<p>“Oh well, I was only foolin’,” the ugly chap
remarked with a poor attempt at a smile. But his
face showed his rage. He moved away in a few
seconds, and shuffled to the end of the porch, where
he soon fell asleep on a bench.</p>

<p>Bob looked over and saw him, as the boys were
discussing the program for the remainder of the
day.</p>

<p>“Let’s play a trick on that brute,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“What kind?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“You watch,” replied Chunky. “You’ll see
some fun.”</p>

<p>Now it happened that the professor had among
his collection of specimens several large stuffed
snakes, for he was an expert taxidermist. There
were also several horned toads and big lizards.
Bob got several of the ugliest ones and, with the
aid of the scientist, who entered into the plan to
pay a well deserved lesson to the miner, arranged
the things about the sleeper, on the bench and on
the floor of the porch.</p>

<p>By this time most of the crowd at the hotel was
aware what was going on, and, as few of them
had any too much love for Simmons they waited the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
outcome with interest. When the reptiles were
placed in a circle about the sleeping miner, one of
the men fired his revolver in the air. At the
sound Simmons awoke.</p>

<p>At first he did not notice the reptiles, as he was
on his back, staring up at the sky. Then he suddenly
sat up, and caught a glimpse of the ugly
looking things. For a moment he seemed to be in
doubt as to what he beheld. Then he let out a yell
that could have been heard almost a half mile.</p>

<p>“Wow!” he cried. “Take ’em away. I’ll
never drink another drop! Honest I won’t! Oh!
Oh! the horrible snakes! I’ll shut my eyes so I
can’t see ’em!”</p>

<p>But when he opened them again the reptiles were
still there.</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh! I see ’em still!” he yelled.
“Take ’em away, somebody, please do. Oh I forgot!
They ain’t real! I only imagine I see
’em!”</p>

<p>He got up on the bench and was dancing about
in terror. Then he drew his revolver, and was
about to fire into the midst of the snakes.</p>

<p>“He’ll ruin my specimens!” cried the professor.</p>

<p>One of the men ran forward, and began collecting
the reptiles. Simmons saw them being
gathered up, and noticed that they were not wiggling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Then the truth of it dawned on him, and
he knew he had been fooled. His companions
laughed loud and long. But Simmons, unable to
stand the jokes and jibes he knew would be poked
at him, leaped over the porch railing and ran down
the road as fast as he could go.</p>

<p>“Serves him right!” was the general verdict.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br />
<small>THE STORY OF LOST LAKE</small></h2>


<p>The trick Bob had played seemed to be much
appreciated among the crowd of miners and herdsmen
who were gathered at the hotel. They
laughed loud and long over the sight Simmons had
presented.</p>

<p>“I guess he’ll know better than to fool with the
next lad that comes along in one of them choo-choo
wagons,” was the hotel proprietor’s comment.</p>

<p>Bob gathered up the specimens that belonged to
the professor and they were put in the car, together
with a fresh supply of provisions that were
purchased at the village store.</p>

<p>“I guess we’ll be traveling,” suggested the professor.
The boys agreed with him, for though
they knew the pleasures of sleeping beneath a roof,
yet the character of the men who stayed at the
hotel was so rough that they feared further rows.
So, in spite of the entreaties of the hotel keeper
they started off, having inquired the best roads to
take.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>Through the afternoon they bowled over a well
elevated table land. The air was fine and bracing.
Off in the distance to the west could be seen
the first ranges of the big mountains.</p>

<p>“That’s where our mine is,” said Jerry, his eyes
shining.</p>

<p>“Maybe it isn’t ours after all,” put in Bob.</p>

<p>“Now there you go, Chunky. What do you
want to call up unpleasant subjects for?” asked
Ned reproachfully. “Anyhow it’s our mine until
some one takes it away from us, and I guess they’ll
have quite a fight, with Nestor on guard.”</p>

<p>The others thought so too. Jerry, who was
steering, was sending the auto forward at a fast
clip, when the professor, who always had his eyes
open called out:</p>

<p>“What’s that just ahead of us? Looks like a
bear.”</p>

<p>“Where?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Right in line with that big rock,” went on the
scientist, who had very good eyes and could see a
long distance.</p>

<p>“It’s only a tree stump,” spoke Bob.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know tree stumps could move,” went
on Mr. Snodgrass, “for this one is certainly coming
toward us. It’s not a bear after all,” he continued,
now that the object was nearer. “It’s a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
bull! That’s what it is! It looks as if it meant
to go for us!”</p>

<p>The boys could now see that the beast was one
of the big, long-horned western cattle. It had evidently
strayed from the herd, or had been made
an outcast because of a bad temper and a perpetual
desire to fight. The latter seemed more likely,
for, as the auto proceeded, and the bull came on,
lessening the distance between the two, a defiant
bellow of rage sounded.</p>

<p>“I hope he don’t try to ram us,” spoke Jerry.
“We don’t want any more collisions.”</p>

<p>“See if you can’t run away from him,” suggested
Ned.</p>

<p>By this time the bull was about one hundred
yards away. It was coming straight for the auto.
Jerry opened the muffler and at the sound of the
explosions the bull stopped short.</p>

<p>At this point the road ran in a sort of depression,
with hills rising on either side. It was rather narrow,
so there was no chance to turn to one side.
Jerry had to bring the machine to a stop or else
run the risk of hitting the bull. He thought the
animal might run away if it saw the machine coming
toward him, but there was nothing sure about
this.</p>

<p>“Well, this is a regular hold-up,” said the professor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
“I wonder whether the bull wants to
collect toll?”</p>

<p>The animal seemed to be growing angrier and
angrier every minute. It bellowed loudly, pawed
the earth with its hoofs, and shook the lowered
head, armed with sharp horns. Occasionally the
keen points would tear up the ground.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t want him to strike one of our tires,”
remarked Ned. “It would be all up with it.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah! I have it!” cried Bob at length.</p>

<p>He dove beneath the rear seat and pulled up a
shining object.</p>

<p>“The ammonia squirt gun!” he exclaimed.
“The same we used on the hold-up tramps. Give
the bull a dose of it!”</p>

<p>“Good idea,” commented Jerry.</p>

<p>The bulb of the automatic pistol was still filled
with the fiery liquid, for the boys kept it loaded in
readiness for use. Bob handed it over to Jerry.
The latter took careful aim, and pressed the rubber.
A fine stream of the powerful stuff struck the
bull full in the face.</p>

<p>With a bellow that fairly shook the ground
near-by the bull reared up in the air, and coming
down on all fours snorted with rage, shook its head
to rid its eyes of the terrible burning, and then
dashed madly away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now I guess we can get past,” remarked Bob,
“and get some supper. I’m as hungry as a bear.”</p>

<p>A good fire was soon started and Ned began
to prepare the meal. While the others were setting
out the dishes, or getting ready for the night
camp, since it seemed there was no place for shelter
in the neighborhood, the travelers were startled by
a voice:</p>

<p>“Evenin’ strangers,” called a tall, thin man who
strolled down the slight hill at the foot of which
the party were encamped. “Have you got a bite
to spare?”</p>

<p>“Plenty,” replied the professor cheerfully.
“Come right along. Supper will be ready in a
little while. Are you hungry?”</p>

<p>“Hungry? I should say so. I haven’t had a
bit to eat for two days, except what berries and
old nuts I could gather.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? Get lost?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Exactly,” replied the stranger. “My name’s
Johnson,” he went on. “I was prospecting up in
the hills, and got lost there.”</p>

<p>“Anybody with you?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Nary a soul; I’m all alone. I used up the last
of my grub in trying to find the trail, and I guess
I’d been looking for it yet if I hadn’t heard the
noise of your steam engine here, and smelled the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
cooking. I s’pose you’re huntin’ for it, same as
me.”</p>

<p>“Hunting for what?” asked the professor,
struck by Johnson’s manner.</p>

<p>“Why Lost Lake, to be sure. Nobody comes
out this far unless they’re huntin’ for the lake, but
you’re the first to come in a steam car without
rails.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s a free country,” remarked the scientist,
wishing to evade giving a direct answer, in
the hope of learning something. “I guess we
have a right to hunt for the lake.”</p>

<p>“Of course, of course you have, strangers,”
went on Johnson. “No offense. Have you
struck a trace of it yet?”</p>

<p>“Not yet,” replied Mr. Snodgrass. “To tell
you the truth,” the professor went on, “we don’t
know much about this lost lake.”</p>

<p>“Nor no one else,” said Johnson. “I’ll tell
you all I know, which isn’t much. I’ve been looking
for it ’most a year now.”</p>

<p>“Suppose we have supper first,” suggested the
professor as he noted the eyes Johnson was casting
at the food. “We can talk afterward.”</p>

<p>“That’s the best word I’ve heard in a good
while,” said the newcomer.</p>

<p>He ate with a rapidity that left no doubt about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
his hunger. Nor were the others far behind him,
as the crisp air of the mountain region had given
them all famous appetites.</p>

<p>“Now for Lost Lake,” spoke Jerry when all
had their fill.</p>

<p>“It’s supposed to be in those mountains over
there,” began Johnson, pointing to the range off
in the west, now dimly discernible in the dusk.
“It’s said to be a beautiful sheet of water, with
high peaks all around it. It was discovered forty
years ago by a prospector, and he came to the nearest
village with the news. But when he went to
lead a party back they couldn’t find the trail.
Ever since then people have tried to find Lost
Lake, but no one has ever succeeded. Many
have been killed trying.”</p>

<p>“But why does any one want to find a lake
hidden in the mountains?” asked Mr. Snodgrass.</p>

<p>“Yes, tell us?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Why, for the gold on its banks, of course,”
said Johnson. “Didn’t I say that? I meant to.
The man who discovered it said there were pebbles
of gold on the shores. He brought back a pocket
full to prove it. I got the fever quite a few
months ago, but nothing has come of all my efforts,
and this time I nearly died. It was terrible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
up in the mountains. There’s not a soul
there I believe.”</p>

<p>“And you didn’t even get a glimpse of the
lake?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Nary a look, young man. But I’m sure it’s
there. I’m going back to town, get a new outfit
and some provisions, and have another try.”</p>

<p>He was another example of how the gold fever
grips one.</p>

<p>“Maybe we’ll come across the lake, though
we’re not looking for it,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“Maybe you will,” assented the prospector.
“That’s generally the way. The first man was
not hunting for it, but he came upon it one
night when the moon was shining. If you do
find it, look out for the old hermit, that’s all.”</p>

<small>A LONELY CABIN</small></h2>


<p>“What hermit?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Why you haven’t heard half the story of Lost
Lake,” went on Johnson. “There’s supposed to
be a sort of wild man who lives on the shores of
the lake, and he murders travelers. At least
that’s the yarn they tell.”</p>

<p>“Was the hermit always there?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“No, only the last few years,” replied Johnson.
“He is said to be an old man with white hair.
But I don’t believe that part. Let me find the
lake and the gold, and I won’t worry about hermits.”</p>

<p>The prospector camped with the travelers that
night. They were all up early the next morning,
and, at the professor’s suggestion the boys gave
Johnson plenty of provisions to last him until he
could get back to civilization.</p>

<p>“Maybe you would like to go along with us
and look for the lake?” suggested Bob.</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” replied Johnson. “I’m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
afraid your chances of finding it are slimmer than
mine are. I’ll have another try all by myself.
I’m much obliged for the help you’ve given me.”</p>

<p>Then, shouldering his pack, he started off down
the trail, while the travelers, packing their things
in the auto, set forward again.</p>

<p>The boys talked about little save the story of
Lost Lake, but the professor was too busy arranging
his latest specimens to join in the conversation.</p>

<p>“I’d like to find it and see the wild hermit,”
said Bob.</p>

<p>“I don’t s’pose you’d care anything about the
gold,” put in Ned.</p>

<p>“Of course I would,” replied Bob. “But
we’ve got one gold mine now, what do we want of
another?”</p>

<p>“It might be well to have a second in case we
lose the first,” Jerry ventured. “Nothing like
having plenty while you’re at it.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t like to be a hermit,” went on Bob.
“Think of always being hungry.”</p>

<p>“Chunky is thinking of misers, I guess,”
laughed Ned. “There’s nothing to prevent a
hermit from living off the fat of the land. If
it wasn’t for being lonesome I’d be a hermit for
a while.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>“Stop the auto!” called the professor suddenly.
“I just saw a fine specimen of a snapping
turtle scoot across the road. I must have
it. It’s worth about twenty dollars to me. Stop
the car! I must get out!”</p>

<p>Ned, who was running the auto, shut off the
power and the machine came to a stop. Before
it had ceased to move Mr. Snodgrass had leaped
out and was running back. He began a hurried
but careful search over the ground. Then he was
seen to spring forward.</p>

<p>“He’s got it, I guess,” remarked Jerry.</p>

<p>An instant later there came a howl from the
scientist, who was hidden from sight by the tall
grass.</p>

<p>“Help, boys! Help!”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? Won’t he let you catch
him?” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“He’s caught me!” yelled the professor.
“Come quick and bring a knife to cut his head
off with!”</p>

<p>The boys piled out of the auto in a hurry,
Jerry stopping to grab up a big carving knife from
the camp utensils.</p>

<p>When they came up to the professor they hardly
knew whether to laugh or not. The turtle, which
was a big one, had grabbed the scientist by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
thumb, and was clinging so tightly that it was
suspended in the air, swaying to and fro.
Meanwhile Mr. Snodgrass was dancing about in
pain.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you take hold of the turtle’s
shell in the other hand, and you won’t feel the
weight so much!” called Jerry.</p>

<p>“I can’t,” replied the professor. “I have a
rare specimen of a toad in my other hand, and
I don’t want to lose it. Oh boys! Hurry up,
and pry the turtle’s jaws open, but don’t hurt him,
for he’s valuable.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you put the toad in your pocket?”
asked Ned, knowing the scientist had no scruples
about loading his garments up with all sorts of
things. “Then you would have one hand free.”</p>

<p>“I never thought of that,” said Mr. Snodgrass.
“I can do that, can’t I?”</p>

<p>He did so, and, once the toad was secure he
took hold of the turtle, which relieved his lacerated
thumb from the dragging weight.</p>

<p>“He won’t let go!” exclaimed the professor,
after a vain attempt to pull the turtle loose. “It
is a genuine snapper, and they have a grip like a
bull dog. I am glad I found it, in spite of the
pain,” he added, though just then, the turtle took
a fresh hold and the professor squirmed in agony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>“Here; I’ll cut its head off,” said Jerry, coming
forward with the knife.</p>

<p>“No, no!” exclaimed the professor. “It is
too valuable to spoil. Just take the point of the
blade, and pry the jaws open while I hold it
steady.”</p>

<p>Jerry tried to do this, but the turtle only seemed
to grip the tighter, and the professor’s thumb was
bitten through nearly to the bone.</p>

<p>“What shall I do?” wailed Mr. Snodgrass.
“I don’t want to kill it.”</p>

<p>“I have it!” exclaimed Ned. “There’s a little
puddle of water over there beside the road.
Dip the turtle in it, and he’ll think he can swim.
Then he’ll let go.”</p>

<p>“Good!” cried the professor as he proceeded
to put the plan in operation. “Then I can save
him alive.”</p>

<p>The scheme worked well. As soon as the turtle
felt the water it let go, and started to swim off.
But the puddle was too shallow, and the professor,
watching his chance, grabbed the reptile again.
This time he took care to catch it at the middle
of the shell, where the turtle could not reach
around and bite.</p>

<p>“I have it, after all,” remarked the scientist
as he deposited his prize in a box, and proceeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
to put some salve and a rag on his thumb. “It’s
a rare specimen. I’m glad I got it.”</p>

<p>“And we’re all glad we didn’t get it,” spoke
Jerry with a laugh in which the others joined.
But the professor took it good naturedly. He was
used to such accidents he said.</p>

<p>Resuming their journey, the travelers made only
one more stop, that at noon, to get dinner. They
had seen no signs of human habitation, and, as
the afternoon wore on, and no house or cabin
was seen, they began to feel that they might as
well prepare to camp out again.</p>

<p>As they were descending a gentle, sloping hill
that led down into a small valley, just as the sun
was setting, they saw, about a mile ahead a lonely
cabin. The sight of smoke coming from the
chimney told them there was some one at home.</p>

<p>“I hope whoever lives there can accommodate
us,” remarked Chunky. “My appetite’s getting
the upper hand of me again.”</p>

<p>“It don’t look large enough to hold us all,”
observed Jerry.</p>

<p>“There’s a barn, or some sort of building, in
the rear,” remarked Ned. “Some of us can use
that if the man or woman lets us.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later the auto came to a stop
in front of the cabin, which was indeed a lonely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
one, not another dwelling, large or small, showing
in the whole valley.</p>

<p>“Good evening,” greeted an old man, with
snow-white hair falling over his shoulders. He
came to the door of the shack, and seemed to regard
the coming travelers as a matter of course.
“I am glad to see you,” he went on. “You are
just in time.”</p>

<p>“Time for what?” asked Mr. Snodgrass.</p>

<p>“For the great final and successful experiment,”
proceeded the aged man. “The test is about to
begin. Come in and see me make gold from common
earth. At last I have found the long-lost secret!”</p>

<p>The eyes of the lonely man glowed with a
strange light, and he seemed so excited that the
boys did not know what to do.</p>

<p>“Humor him,” advised the professor in a whisper.
“He is probably a harmless lunatic. Let
him have his way, and pretend to agree with all
he says.”</p>

<p>“Will you come in?” went on the old man.
“I must proceed with my work.”</p>

<p>“We’ll be glad to,” went on the scientist.
“That is, if we will not disturb you at your labors.”</p>

<p>“My labors are now ended,” the man said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
“I have worked for twenty years on the secret
of making gold from the baser metals. At last
I have the correct method. I will be a millionaire
in another month. But come in! Come
in!”</p>

<p>The boys, obeying Mr. Snodgrass’s advice, went
in, the scientist following them. They saw that
the cabin, though small, was neat and clean.
Nearly all of the first of two rooms was occupied
by a large, rudely made furnace, while on a table
near it stood all sorts of chemical apparatus. On
the furnace a pot was boiling furiously.</p>

<p>“Now for the last act in the drama of life,”
said the aged man. “See, I place in the pot these
pieces of brass,” and he showed the travelers some
chunks of the yellow stuff. He put them in the
pot, from which arose a cloud of steam.</p>

<p>“Next I throw in this powder, which I have
labored on for years. It is the secret that men
would give their lives for.”</p>

<p>He threw the powder into the pot, which boiled
more furiously than before, and a white cloud of
steam arose. Then it died away, and the pot
seemed to cool off.</p>

<p>“Now for the gold!” exclaimed the chemist.</p>

<p>He lifted the pot from the furnace, and, holding
it with some thick cloths poured the water off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
into a hole in the ground floor of the cabin. Out
toppled the pieces of brass which had been thrown
in, but while they had been dull before, they now
glittered with the yellow gleam of gold.</p>

<p>“The test! The test!” exclaimed the old man
in a voice that trembled with eagerness.</p>

<p>He placed one of the yellow pieces on the
table, and put a few drops of gold-testing acid
on it. There was a little hissing sound, and then,
on the shiny surface of the piece of metal there
came a dull black spot. The old man uttered a
despairing cry.</p>

<p>“Another failure!” he exclaimed. “It is
brass still. I thought it would turn to gold! I
must have made a mistake in mixing the powder.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a><br />
<small>THE INDIAN AND THE AUTO</small></h2>


<p>For a few moments the scientist who hoped he
had discovered the fabled power to transmute
metals stared at the result of his latest trial. He
appeared lost in thought. Then he seemed to
recollect that there were strangers present.</p>

<p>“I am sorry my experiment did not succeed,”
he said in a more quiet voice than he had yet used.
“I hoped to show you what I can do. Well, I
must try again. I think I know where I made the
error. I had too much soda in the powder. I
will use less next time.”</p>

<p>“We are sorry to interrupt your experiments,”
put in the professor, “but we are travelers, and
our object in stopping here was to find out if you
could take us in for the night.”</p>

<p>“Gladly,” replied the old man. “There is a
barn in the rear, but it has not been occupied in
years; not since I came here. You are welcome
to use that. Some of you can spend the night in
the rear room. As for me I shall not go to bed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
I must start at once and make up some fresh
powders.”</p>

<p>“I think perhaps we had all better sleep in the
barn,” said the professor. “Then we will not
disturb you at your labors.”</p>

<p>The truth of it was Mr. Snodgrass saw that the
aged man was not altogether right in his head,
and he preferred not to be too near in case the
fellow should suddenly become violent.</p>

<p>“Just as you like, just as you like,” was the
reply to the professor’s decision, and the chemist
seemed to be dreaming over some problem he was
trying to solve.</p>

<p>“May we cook some of our food on your
stove?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Why certainly. I beg your pardon for not
mentioning supper,” spoke the man, “but you see
I am so used to getting a bite whenever I need
it, so as not to interrupt my work, that I forgot
there is such a thing as hospitality. Make yourselves
at home, and, if you find anything in the
cupboards help yourselves. Meanwhile please
excuse me if I do not join you. I must go out and
gather some roots and herbs I need in my experiments.”</p>

<p>He left the cabin, and, after bringing in some
provisions from the auto, having first ascertained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
that there were few in the cabin, the travelers proceeded
to make a meal.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose he can be the hermit of Lost
Lake?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Well, he’s certainly a hermit,” spoke the professor,
“but I don’t believe there’s a lake of any
kind about here. Certainly if he was the hermit
of the lake he would not be away off here. No,
I am inclined to think we shall never see the lost
lake or the hermit either.”</p>

<p>“Do you think it will be safe to stay here all
night?” inquired Chunky.</p>

<p>“I think so,” was the professor’s reply. “You
see we will be out in another building, and we can
fasten the door. If he tries to get in, which I
am sure he will not, he will make noise enough
to awaken us.”</p>

<p>“We could mount guard,” suggested Ned.</p>

<p>“It will not be necessary,” Mr. Snodgrass said.</p>

<p>Nor did the travelers find it so. After their
meal, having left a good supply of victuals for
the old man in case he came back, they retired
to the rear building where they slept soundly.</p>

<p>After breakfast, which the old man did not
spend more than five minutes over, the travelers
prepared to resume their trip.</p>

<p>“You had better stay one more night,” urged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
the owner of the cabin. “I feel sure that I shall
be successful to-night. I have discovered a new
root. See, I call it gold threads,” and he held
up some bulbs that had been dug from the ground.
Clinging to them were small yellow fibres or roots.
“I found them last night, down in the hollow by
the mineral spring,” the man went on. “I am
sure they are just what I need. Please stay; won’t
you?”</p>

<p>But the professor told him, as gently as possible,
that they must keep on. So, after bidding the
gold-seeker good bye, and wishing him success,
the boys and Mr. Snodgrass proceeded, the auto
puffing along at a good rate.</p>

<p>The weather continued fine and the air was bracing
and cool, for they were well up among the foothills
now. During the morning the road led
up a gentle slope, but at noon they camped on a
sort of ridge that marked the divide. On the
other side was a vast plain, bounded at the further
side by tall mountains.</p>

<p>It was well along in the afternoon, when having
descended to the plain, the travelers found
themselves bowling along a fine road, on either
side of which were rolling fields. Mile after mile
was covered, everyone enjoying the trip very much.
The professor, however, was beginning to show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
signs of uneasiness. He fidgeted about in his seat,
and seemed unable to remain quiet.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Bob at length.</p>

<p>“To tell you the truth,” said the scientist, “I
want to get out and get some specimens, but I did
not like to ask you, for I do not want to delay
the party.”</p>

<p>They all voted that the professor should be
given a chance to get as many specimens as he
wanted. Accordingly Jerry brought the car to
a stop, and the boys and the scientist got out.</p>

<p>As the engine had not been running as smoothly
as was desirable Jerry did not shut off the power,
merely throwing out the gear clutches. He said
he wanted to have the cylinders warm up, and so
the engine was left going, though the car itself
stood still.</p>

<p>The professor was soon busy gathering insects
of various kinds from the tall grass, and even
crawling on his hands and knees over the ground.
The boys walked some distance off, to stretch their
legs, for they were a little tired of sitting still so
long.</p>

<p>Suddenly Bob, who happened to glance back toward
the auto, uttered a cry.</p>

<p>“Look!” he shouted. “Some one is stealing
our car and going off in it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>The others looked. The sight that met their
eyes was enough to astonish any one. Climbing
into the automobile was a big Indian, attired
in gay colored blankets, a rifle slung across his
back, while near him stood a Pinto pony, clean-cut
and wiry.</p>

<p>While they watched they saw the red man seat
himself comfortably at the steering wheel, reach
forward to throw the gear clutch in place, and
then the car moved off, taking the Indian with it.</p>

<p>“Here! Come back!”</p>

<p>“Stop that auto!”</p>

<p>“Get out of that!”</p>

<p>These were some of the things the boys yelled
at the bold thief. But all of no avail. The Indian
threw in the second gear, and the auto went
faster than before.</p>

<p>“Come on! We must catch him!” cried
Jerry, and he began to run in the direction the
auto was fast disappearing in, down the road.</p>

<p>“We can never catch him,” called Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes we can! He can’t know anything about
running an auto!” panted Jerry. “He’ll put on
the brake or pull the wrong lever next, and the machine
will stop!”</p>

<p>“That is unless he blows it up first or smashes
it,” said Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Mr. Snodgrass,
appearing at this juncture.</p>

<p>Bob was the only one left to tell him, as Jerry
and Ned were running down the road at top speed.
But it seemed that their race would be useless,
for the auto was now running on third gear. And,
strangest of all, <a href="#image02">the Indian seemed to know how
to operate it</a>. He kept a straight course, and the
puffing of the exhaust told Jerry that the engine
was running to perfection, with a good supply of
gasolene, and the spark coming regularly.</p>

boys the auto went. It seemed hopeless to keep
after it, but neither Jerry nor Ned would give up.
They realized what it meant to lose their machine,
though they could not understand how an Indian,
in all his wild regalia, would think of getting into
an auto.</p>

<p>Suddenly there sounded down the road the patter
of hoof beats.</p>

<p>“Maybe that’s more Indians,” said Jerry turning
around and slowing up in his running.</p>

<p>“No,” he added, “it’s Bob on the Indian’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
pony. I wonder you or I didn’t think of that.”</p>

<p>“He couldn’t catch up with the auto if he had
two ponies,” growled Ned.</p>

<p>“The only chance is that the gasolene may give
out, or the sparker refuse to work, or that he may
run into a sand bank,” lamented Jerry.</p>

<p>“And there don’t seem to be much chance of
either taking place right off,” put in Ned. “Hark!
What’s that?”</p>

<p>From down the road sounded the <em>Toot!
Toot!</em> of the auto horn.</p>

<p>“It sounds as if he was coming back,” said
Jerry. Just then Bob caught up to them on the
pony.</p>

<small>LOST LAKE FOUND</small></h2>


<p>“Let me past! I’ll catch him!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute! Maybe that’s him coming
back?” replied Jerry.</p>

<p>Sure enough the next instant the auto, which
had been lost to sight by reason of a turn in the
road, came into view.</p>

<p>Straight up the highway it came, the figure of
the Indian, wrapped in his blanket, with his headdress
of feathers, an altogether brilliant figure,
seated at the wheel; a strange enough combination
as any one will admit.</p>

<p>The red man acted as though he had been used
to running autos all his life. He sat straight as
an arrow, his hands grasping the wheel, which
was sending the car straight for the boys.</p>

<p>“He’s just doing this to taunt us!” exclaimed
Jerry. “I have a good notion to take a shot
at one of the tires with my revolver and scare him
into stopping.”</p>

<p>“Don’t do it! You might kill him,” said Ned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
“and you wouldn’t want to do that. But what
does he mean by stealing the car, and then bringing
it back?”</p>

<p>A few seconds later the auto drew up in front
of the boys, who had come to a halt. With an
ease that bespoke long experience the Indian
brought the machine to a stop, and then, while
the lads looked on, so full of wonder at the whole
occurrence that they did not know what to say,
the red man grunted:</p>

<p>“Heap fine wagon. Ugh! Indian like um,
he buy um! How much?”</p>

<p>“Look here!” burst out Jerry, so angry that
he hardly took note of what the red man had said.
“Do you know you are a&mdash;”</p>

<p>Then a strange thing happened. Wrapping his
blankets closely about him, and drawing himself
up to his full height of over six feet, the Indian
said calmly:</p>

<p>“I really beg your pardon for the unwarranted
liberty I took with your car, but when I saw it
standing out here, so far from civilization, I could
not resist the temptation to take a ride. I trust
you will overlook it.”</p>

<p>For a moment the boys were speechless, for the
Indian they had supposed one from the half-wild
plain tribes, and whose every appearance indicated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
that, had spoken in English as cultured as that
of a college professor.</p>

<p>“What&mdash;why&mdash;when&mdash;where?” stammered
Jerry, and the Indian burst into a laugh.</p>

<p>“I see I must explain,” he said. “I am not
what I seem.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you an Indian?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“A full blooded one, and the chief of a tribe,”
spoke the red man. “But I am not the half
dime library sort.</p>

<p>“You see,” he went on, “I have just come back
from the school at Carlisle, where I am taking a
post graduate course. I felt a sudden longing to
don the dress of my ancestors, and roam the broad
fields. I did so, starting from my home on the
reservation this morning. I came along and saw
the auto. As I said, the temptation was too strong
to resist. I got in and took a little spin, as you
saw. I am sorry if I caused you annoyance, or
made you fear your machine had been stolen.”</p>

<p>The eyes of the Indian twinkled and, beneath
the paint on his face, the boys could see a smile
coming.</p>

<p>“But how in the world did you learn to run
a car?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Easy enough,” was the answer. “I acted
as chauffeur for several months this vacation to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
earn money enough to continue my studies. I
got to be quite an expert. That is a fine car you
have.”</p>

<p>“Well I’m stumped!” exclaimed Bob.</p>

<p>“How do you like my pony?” asked the red
man. “I think we made a sort of unfair exchange,
though, in spite of the fact that the animal
is valuable. Now let me apologize once
more, and then I will take my animal and go
home.”</p>

<p>“You are welcome to the ride,” said Jerry.
“We were so surprised at first that we took you
for a thief.”</p>

<p>“I don’t blame you,” spoke the Indian. “The
sight of a red man in an automobile is enough to
make any one wonder. Well, heap big chief,
Whistling Wind in the Pine, must go.”</p>

<p>“Is that your name?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“It’s my Indian one,” was the answer, “but
at the school I am known as Paul Rader. Now let
me bid you good day, and a pleasant journey.”</p>

<p>Then, before they could ask him to take a ride
with them, the boys saw the Indian leap on his
pony, from which Bob had dismounted, and ride
away at a smart gallop, his blanket flying out behind
him in the wind.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s the limit!” exclaimed Ned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
“To think of a wild-civilized Indian playing a
trick like that.”</p>

<p>“I certainly thought he was as wild as they
come,” put in Bob. “I was afraid it was all up
with us.”</p>

<p>Then the professor appeared and they told him
the story.</p>

<p>“I wish I had met him,” said the professor.</p>

<p>“What for; did you know him?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“No, but he would probably be able to tell me
where to get some fine specimens,” remarked the
scientist.</p>

<p>In a short time they were all in the auto again,
and were bowling along over the table land, the
machine humming in a way that told that the
cylinders were working well. They camped for
supper, and then, as it was a fine moon light night
they determined to continue on slowly, as they
wanted to make up for lost time.</p>

<p>The moon rose early, a big silver disk shining
among the trees, when the autoists started on their
night journey.</p>

<p>“This is great!” exclaimed Bob, who seemed
to have forgotten his desire for a bed under shelter.
“Wouldn’t it be fun to have a lot of Indians
chase us now?”</p>

<p>“It might if they were tame ones,” put in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
Jerry, who was steering, “but excuse me from
any wild ones.”</p>

<p>The road soon began a gentle ascent, and the
auto ran more slowly up the hill. The road, too,
became narrower, winding in and out. The trees,
which had been scattering, were thicker, and the
travelers could see they were getting well up
among the mountains.</p>

<p>“How late are you going to travel?” asked
Bob of Jerry.</p>

<p>“Until nearly midnight,” was the answer.
“The moon begins to go down then and it will
not be very safe. But I think we ought to cover
as big a distance as possible while we can. We
have had delays enough.”</p>

<p>The only noise, besides the puffing of the machine,
were the cries of owls, the chirping of
crickets and katy-dids, with, now and then, the
howl of a wolf or fox. In spite of the number in
the party, there was a feeling of loneliness about
being so far from civilization among the wilds of
the mountain region.</p>

<p>Up and up went the car, until the ascent became
so steep that Jerry was obliged to run on the
low gear. This made progress slow, and, because
of the uneven road, so risky, that it seemed
unwise to proceed further that night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll slow up when we get to the top of this
hill,” said Jerry, “and we’ll go into camp.”</p>

<p>But he reckoned without knowing what sort of
a hill it was, nor did he calculate on the auto failing
to stop as soon as he expected. For that was
what happened. Reaching the summit of the slope
Jerry shut off the power.</p>

<p>But something went wrong with the mechanism.
The auto continued on, slowly to be sure, but
with enough momentum to send it over the brow
of the hill. Then it plunged down on the other
side, gathering speed every minute.</p>

<p>“Is she running away?” asked Ned. “Seems
so to me.”</p>

<p>“She’s not behaving as well as she should,”
replied Jerry, “but I have her under control.
The brake is working all right,” which fact he
soon ascertained.</p>

<p>Faster and faster, however, in spite of the
brake, did the auto plunge down the slope. Jerry
kept his head, however, and was working to bring
the machine to a halt. All at once Bob, looking
up, saw where the road made a sudden turn to
the left.</p>

<p>“Look out for that!” he cried, pointing.</p>

<p>Jerry tried to make the turn, but the steering
wheel suddenly became a little stiff, so that, instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
of the car being turned to the left, and
around the bend, it kept straight on.</p>

<p>There was a crackling of brush and tree
branches, and the big machine left the road and
began plowing up the side of a slope, around the
lower edge of which the road wound.</p>

<p>“Duck!” cried Ned, as a tree branch hit him
in the face.</p>

<p>They all did so, and the next instant the big
machine crashed through some briars, bending
down several saplings in its journey. Then, having
exhausted the momentum, the auto came to
a stop, at the summit of the little slope, and Jerry
jammed on the brakes to hold it there, the band
this time gripping the axle firmly.</p>

<p>“Look! Oh look!” cried Ned, pointing ahead
and down below them.</p>

<p>There, in a sort of basin formed by high hills,
lay a body of water, sparkling and beautiful in
the moonlight, the shadows of tall black mountains
reflected in its calm surface.</p>

<p>“It’s Lost Lake!” exclaimed Jerry, softly.
“Boys! We have found Lost Lake! I am sure
of it!”</p>

<p>For a few seconds no one spoke after that, for
they were all lost in wonder at the beauty and
strangeness of the sight. It was so quiet that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
it seemed almost as if it was but a picture painted
by a master’s hand.</p>

<p>Suddenly Bob, who was staring intently at the
upper end of the lake, grasped Ned by the arm.</p>

<p>“See,” he whispered. “What’s that? That
thing in white?”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a><br />
<small>THE GHOST OF THE LAKE</small></h2>


<p>They all looked to where Bob pointed. At
first they could make out nothing, but Bob insisted
that he had seen some tall, white object
moving.</p>

<p>“It was just like the description of ghosts,”
he said, with a queer little laugh.</p>

<p>“I see it,” said Jerry, softly. “Right by the
big white birch.”</p>

<p>“Sure enough,” remarked the professor.</p>

<p>Then they all beheld a tall white form in the
pale moonlight, gliding from tree to tree, on the
shore of the lake.</p>

<p>“Look, it is picking up something from the
shore,” said Ned. “Maybe it’s the hermit the
miner told us about, gathering gold.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” said Jerry. “It’s probably a bit
of fog, or it may be a white fox, or a wolf.”</p>

<p>“No fox or wolf is as big as that,” insisted Ned.
“I’ll bet it’s the hermit.”</p>

<p>“Whatever it is, it’s gone now,” put in Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>And, sure enough, the object suddenly disappeared
among the trees, and there was nothing in
sight but the lake, the mountains and the moonlight.</p>

<p>“Well, we seem to have stumbled onto the
lake,” remarked Jerry. “If the auto had not misbehaved
we would have taken the regular road,
and Lost Lake would still be lost. As it is we
have found it.”</p>

<p>“I hope we find some of the gold, as well,”
put in Ned. “We may need the yellow pebbles
if our mine is gone.”</p>

<p>“Whatever we do, we shall stay here until
morning,” said Jerry. “It will be a good place
to camp, anyhow, gold or no gold.”</p>

<p>So they all busied themselves in preparing to
stay there for the rest of the night. A fire was
built and a midnight supper was soon in preparation.
They had good appetites, and, tired with
the day’s journey and events, they got out their
blankets and slept soundly.</p>

<p>By daylight the lake was seen to be a large
sheet of water, rather irregular in outline, with
many small bays and coves. Shimmering in the
sunlight the water made a beautiful picture.</p>

<p>“Here goes to see if there are any golden pebbles
on the shore,” remarked Bob, with a whoop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
as soon as he had crawled from the improvised bed.
He did not have to stop and dress for the travelers
slept in their clothes.</p>

<p>Chunky climbed down the slope, along a rather
rough path to the water. Some time later Jerry
and Ned were about to follow, when they heard
Bob yelling at the top of his voice.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” called Jerry.</p>

<p>“Have you found the gold?” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“Maybe the hermit has attacked him,” suggested
the professor.</p>

<p>They all ran to the water’s edge. When they
reached the shore Bob was nowhere in sight.</p>

<p>“Hi, Bob! Where are you?” cried Jerry looking
around.</p>

<p>“Here!” exclaimed Chunky, suddenly, bobbing
up from beneath the little waves about one hundred
feet from shore.</p>

<p>“Did you fall in?” asked the professor, anxiously.</p>

<p>“No, I jumped in,” replied the boy. “I’m
in swimming. Come on in, the water’s fine!”</p>

<p>“Good for you!” called Ned and the next
instant he was undressed and splashing out toward
Bob. Jerry soon joined them, and even the professor
took a dip. The water was somewhat cool,
but after they were once in it was invigorating,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
and they swam about for half an hour, greatly enjoying
the luxury of a bath.</p>

<p>“Hark! What was that?” asked Ned, suddenly.</p>

<p>There came a whirring of wings and a rustling
of the leaves of the bushes off to the left. Then
a bevy of birds sailed through the air.</p>

<p>“Partridge, or some similar bird, I would say,”
was the professor’s opinion.</p>

<p>“And there goes a big rabbit!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes, and there’s another!” exclaimed Jerry.
“Say, we have struck a game country if we haven’t
a gold one. I say, what’s the matter with having
a hunt?”</p>

<p>“Good!” cried Bob and Ned.</p>

<p>“I think it would do no harm to replenish the
larder with something fresh,” remarked the professor.</p>

<p>Accordingly, after breakfast, guns were gotten
ready and the boys and the professor tramped
off through the woods, taking care not to go too
far from the lake, as the trees were thick, and,
as there were no trails blazed, it would be easy
to get lost.</p>

<p>Ned bagged the first partridge, and Bob came
second, getting two in succession. Jerry had hard
luck, for twice he missed easy shots. A little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
later, however, he bowled over a plump rabbit,
and followed it up with a second. Then Ned got
one, and Jerry succeeded in bagging a couple of
fine birds.</p>

<p>Some of the game was served for dinner, which
was eaten by a campfire, and very fine it was voted.
Then some was packed away in salt, against a
possible time when provisions might be hard to
get.</p>

<p>“What do you say, shall we stay here another
night or push on?” asked Jerry, about the middle
of the afternoon.</p>

<p>“If you ask me,” said the professor, “I should
say to remain here. I saw a number of fine and
rare specimens I would like to gather.”</p>

<p>“The only thing is, perhaps we had better join
Nestor as soon as possible,” remarked Ned.</p>

<p>“I think a few days’ delay can do no harm,”
Mr. Snodgrass said. “From the tone of Nestor’s
letter I would say there was no immediate
danger of the mine being claimed by others.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll stay,” said Jerry. “I would like
to investigate the lake a little more. We did not
go very far along the shore. Perhaps there might
be an outcropping of gold somewhere around this
locality.”</p>

<p>“And maybe we will see the hermit, or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
ghost, or whatever it is,” added Ned. “Let’s
stay.”</p>

<p>“Then we ought to rig up some kind of shelter,”
went on Jerry. “It may rain in the night,
and it’s not the most pleasant thing in the world
to sleep in a mud puddle.”</p>

<p>“We can build a shack of boughs,” said Bob.</p>

<p>And this they did. They had often done the
same thing before. Branches from a pine tree,
stacked up against a sapling cut to fit between the
crotches of two trees, with the same sort of boughs
for a roof and floor, made a very good shelter.
Rubber blankets on top insured the rain being kept
out, and with woolen coverings for inside, beds
were made that were very comfortable.</p>

<p>When these preparations had been made it was
growing dusk. While Bob and Ned were getting
supper, and the professor was busy arranging his
specimens gathered that day, Jerry removed one
of the big search-lights from the auto.</p>

<p>“What are doing that for?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“I’m going to try and find out what that white
thing is,” said Jerry. “I’m going to rig up a
lantern in front of the shack, facing the lake, and
if the hermit or whatever it is, shows up, I’m going
to flash the light on it.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it won’t come to-night,” suggested Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>But it did. It was along about midnight when
Ned felt a light touch on his arm.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” he asked, sitting up.</p>

<p>“Come on,” whispered Jerry. “I see something
down by the lake, and I want to investigate.
Be careful, don’t make any noise.”</p>

<p>Bob and the professor were both sleeping so
soundly that they did not hear Jerry and Ned leave
the shack.</p>

<p>“Where is it?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“There,” replied Jerry, pointing to a spot about
three hundred feet away, and on the shore of the
lake. “It was there a minute ago, but it’s gone
now. Watch, it will come back.”</p>

<p>He busied himself over the search-light, making
ready to light it quickly and flash the beams
on the ghost or hermit, or whatever it should
prove to be.</p>

<p>“There it is!” called Ned, in a hoarse whisper.
“Right by that big rock that runs out into
the water.”</p>

<p>“I see!” said Jerry, softly.</p>

<p>There was a hissing sound as Jerry turned on
the acetylene gas, a snapping sound as he lit the
match, and then a slight puff as the vapor ignited.
The next instant a glaring shaft of light shot down
toward the lake, glint on a strange object.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>There in the glare of the white beams stood the
figure of an old man. His hair was snow white,
and hung down long over his shoulders. He
seemed bent with age, and this was made more
pronounced because he bore a heavy bag on his
back. He was right at the edge of the water.</p>

<p>The sudden glare had startled him, and he
turned in surprise and fear to see whence it came.
His face stood out in strong relief, and Jerry
started, for he dimly remembered seeing some one
who looked like that some time before.</p>

<p>Then, all at once the stillness of the night was
broken by a shrill scream. Ned and Jerry were
startled, and Bob and the professor, in the shack,
were awakened.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a><br />
<small>THE MYSTERIOUS WOMAN</small></h2>


<p>“Look!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>Then, as he and Jerry watched what took place
in the circle of light, they beheld a woman, her
long hair streaming down her back, run from the
woods up to the old man. In her hand she held
a big club, and with it she endeavored to strike the
aged man. The latter dropped his sack, and
seemed to engage in a struggle with the woman.</p>

<p>“He’s killing her!” exclaimed Ned. “This
is the hermit we were warned against.”</p>

<p>“Come on!” cried Jerry. “We must see
what it means.”</p>

<p>But, just as he started down the slope, the
search-light went out, leaving the place in utter
blackness, for the moon was under a cloud.
When Jerry had succeeded in getting the light going
again, the man and woman were nowhere to
be seen.</p>

<p>“Well, that certainly was a queer sight,” remarked
Ned. “I wonder what it all means?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>“I guess we’ll have to stay here until we find
out,” said Jerry. “It looked as if there was going
to be trouble, at one time.”</p>

<p>“What’s all the excitement about?” asked the
professor, coming out of the shack, followed by
Bob.</p>

<p>Jerry related what they had seen, and the professor
agreed that it would be better to remain and
make an investigation.</p>

<p>“I say, you fellows are mean to go off alone and
have a cracking adventure like that,” objected Bob,
in a grieved tone.</p>

<p>“We didn’t want to disturb your slumbers,”
said Ned.</p>

<p>“Don’t eat so much supper next time, and you
will not sleep so sound,” advised Jerry. But Bob
was not to be appeased until promised that the next
time Ned and Jerry went ghost hunting they would
take him with them.</p>

<p>Having been so thoroughly aroused from their
sleep the travelers decided to sit up a while and see
if they could catch another glimpse of the strange
man and woman. But, though they sat and talked
for more than an hour, there was no further sign
of the two queer creatures.</p>

<p>“I’m going to bed,” announced Bob at length,
and the others decided to follow his example.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
They slept soundly until morning, though Jerry said
afterward that he dreamed he was being chased
across the frozen lake by a white haired man on a
black horse. He got stuck in the ice, and was
freezing to death, when he awakened to find that
his blanket had slipped from him, and that a cold
rain was blowing in through the cracks of the
shack. Morning had dawned cold and dreary.</p>

<p>“Wow! This isn’t exactly pleasant!” exclaimed
Jerry, as he poked his head out of the
front of the screen of branches. “I wish there
was a hotel handy.”</p>

<p>The others crawled from beneath the blankets,
not in any too good humor at the dismal prospect.</p>

<p>“And I’ll bet there isn’t any dry wood to be
had,” said Bob. “That means a cold breakfast.”</p>

<p>A search proved that he was right. Nor was
there any charcoal, since the last had been used
some days before, and they had been to no place
where they could get more.</p>

<p>“Just when a fellow needs a hot cup of coffee,”
went on Bob. “I never saw such beastly luck.”</p>

<p>Jerry said nothing. He seemed to be studying
over some matter.</p>

<p>“I have it,” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“What? Some dry wood?” asked Ned with
much eagerness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, but I know how to make some hot coffee,”
was the answer.</p>

<p>Jerry lost no time in explaining. He first went
to the auto where he got out rubber coats for himself
and his companions. Then, ready to defy the
rain, which was coming down at a good clip, Jerry
hunted about until he found two large stones.
These he set up a short distance apart, placing another
each at the front and rear of the first two.</p>

<p>“There’s the stove,” he remarked.</p>

<p>“A heap of good it will do, with no fire in it,”
growled Bob.</p>

<p>“Wait,” advised Jerry.</p>

<p>Taking the big search-light, which he had used
the night previous, he removed the top, so that
the flame could be used for cooking purposes.
They prepared a good meal and enjoyed it.</p>

<p>It continued to rain, and to fill in time the boys
went fishing in the lake. Luck was with them and
within half an hour they had ten fine fish, and
then, though they could have taken many more,
they did not, as Jerry said they would have no use
for them.</p>

<p>“Fish for dinner for me to-day,” said Bob, while
the others laughed at his usual exhibition of how
fond of eating he was. The fish did prove an
excellent dish, fried in corn meal on Jerry’s improvised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
stove. Some bacon gave them a relish,
and with hot coffee they felt they had as good a
meal as many a hotel could serve.</p>

<p>“I wonder where the professor is?” said Ned,
when the meal was almost over. “I forgot that
he wasn’t with us.”</p>

<p>“He’s off gathering birds, bugs or reptiles,”
said Jerry. “He’ll come when he feels good and
hungry.”</p>

<p>“He’s more likely to forget all about being hungry
if he gets chasing a fine specimen,” remarked
Ned. “I think I’ll just take a stroll and see if
I can come across him.”</p>

<p>“We’ll go along,” said Jerry and Bob.</p>

<p>So the three started off together. They could
easily follow the professor’s trail, as he had broken
through the underbrush, snapping off many twigs
and breaking small branches. The boys wandered
on for nearly a mile, but saw no sign of the
scientist. They were about to turn back, and
wait for him at camp, when Jerry held up his hand
to indicate silence.</p>

<p>“Hark!” he whispered.</p>

<p>The others stood still, and, listening intently,
heard above the patter of the raindrops, voices in
conversation.</p>

<p>“That’s the professor,” said Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>“Some one is with him then,” put in Jerry.
“They are coming this way.”</p>

<p>The sounds of persons advancing through the
bushes could be heard. The voices also sounded
plainer. A minute later the brush was parted and
the professor, followed by a woman, came out into
the little clearing where the boys were. At the
sight of the woman, Jerry started, for he recognized
her as the strange person who had been with
the old man the night previous. The professor
seemed excited about something.</p>

<p>“Boys, this lady has just told me some strange
news,” he said.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Beware of the hermit of Lost Lake!” the
woman exclaimed suddenly. “Have a care of
him. Many poor travelers has he murdered. He
would have murdered you last night if I had not
prevented him.”</p>

<p>“So that’s what it was all about,” said Jerry,
half aloud. The woman heard him, and turned:</p>

<p>“Did you see him?” she asked. “Did you see
me?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;we&mdash;” began Jerry.</p>

<p>“You have been spying on me!” exclaimed the
woman, growing much excited.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a><br />
<small>THE DEN OF THE HERMIT</small></h2>


<p>“No, no!” said the professor calmly. “The
boys were not spying. They happened to see a
man and a woman on the shore of the lake last
night, and they thought it might have been you.”</p>

<p>“It was me,” said the woman. “I was trying
to prevent him from coming and killing you all in
your sleep.”</p>

<p>The boys began to feel a queer creepy sensation
run up their spines, as if some one had poured cold
water down their backs.</p>

<p>“It’s true,” the strange creature went on. “I
will tell you all about it. Listen to me,” and she
sat down on a stump.</p>

<p>“Perhaps we had better go where there is shelter,”
suggested Jerry, for it was raining hard
again, though the boys and the professor in their
rubber coats did not mind it. The woman was
drenched.</p>

<p>“No,” she said. “I can go to no place save
these woods. I am safe from him here.” She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
seemed nervous and excited, and her eyes seemed
unnaturally bright.</p>

<p>“The old man is a hermit,” she went on.
“He has lived near this lake for many years. He
kills travelers and takes their money. He tried to
kill me but I escaped from him because I can run
fast. Since then he has been after me. Last
night he started for your camp, but I got a big
club and stopped him. Then he ran away.”</p>

<p>“What was in the bag?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“What bag?” asked the woman.</p>

<p>“The one the old man had on his back?”</p>

<p>“Hush! Don’t speak about it,” was the reply.
“He had a murdered man’s body in there, and he
threw it into the lake.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure?” asked the professor, thinking
the woman might, perhaps, be trying to scare them
away.</p>

<p>“Positive,” she replied. “I saw him kill the
poor fellow, but the hermit did not know I was
watching.”</p>

<p>“Where does he live?” asked the professor.</p>

<p>“He has a den in the darkest part of the
woods,” was the answer. “He takes travelers
there and kills them. He does not know that I
know where it is, but I do. Would you like to
see it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not if he is the kind of a person you say he
is,” spoke Jerry. “I think we had better steer
clear of him.”</p>

<p>“I can take you there when he is not at home,”
said the woman. “Listen, once each week he
takes a long trip over the mountain, to bury the
gold he has taken from travelers. I can hide and
watch him go. Then I could come and bring you
to his den. Shall I?”</p>

<p>“It might be a good plan,” mused the professor.
“If this man is a murderer he should be
taken in charge by the authorities. Yes, come
and let us know when he goes away. Perhaps we
could capture him ourselves.”</p>

<p>“I’ll come,” said the woman. “Now I must
go, for I hear some one coming,” and, rising suddenly,
she ran off at top speed through the woods.
The boys listened intently but could hear no one
approaching, and began to think the woman must
have been mistaken.</p>

<p>“Where did you meet her?” asked Jerry of the
professor, when it was seen that the woman was
not coming back.</p>

<p>“She saw me while I was gathering some specimens,”
was the reply, “and she came up to warn me
about the hermit. It seems that she lives not far
away, and roams through the woods. Besides telling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
me about the old man, and to be on our guard
against him, she showed me where to get some
beautiful tree toads,” and the scientist opened his
pocket and showed it full of the little creatures.</p>

<p>“Do you think she is telling the truth about the
hermit?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“There may be some exaggeration to it,” rejoined
the professor, “but I have heard of old
half crazed men who lived in the woods as this one
does, and who occasionally murdered lone travelers.
We can’t be too careful.”</p>

<p>“Besides, it did look as though she was trying
to prevent him doing something last night,” put in
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll keep a good lookout,” suggested
the professor. “That’s all we can do now, unless
we decide to move on away from this place.”</p>

<p>“I would rather like to solve the mystery,” said
Jerry. “I do not think we have much to fear. He
is an old man, and I guess we four are a match for
him.”</p>

<p>“Then we had better do as the woman says,
wait until she comes to lead us to his hut, or cabin,
or whatever it is,” the professor advised after a
moment’s thought.</p>

<p>That plan settled on, they made their way back
to camp and the professor was given his rather late<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
dinner. But he did not seem to mind this in the
least.</p>

<p>“Are you going to keep watch again to-night?”
asked Bob of Jerry.</p>

<p>“Of course. I want to get at the bottom of
this. There is a mystery somewhere, and I think
the hermit, the lost lake and the strange woman,
together, can explain it.”</p>

<p>The rain stopped after supper, though it remained
cloudy, and Jerry again prepared the gas
lamp. It was arranged that he and Ned would
stay up on guard until twelve o’clock and that Bob
and the professor would take the rest of the night.
Whichever party saw the hermit was at once to
notify the other.</p>

<p>Jerry and Ned began their vigil. Several
hours passed and it seemed they were to have their
trouble for their pains. At length, however, just
as they were preparing to turn in and let the others
take their turn, Jerry saw a movement in the
bushes about five hundred feet away, and down
near the edge of the lake. The moon, shining
faintly through the clouds, illuminated the scene.</p>

<p>“Be ready to turn on the light when I say so,”
said Jerry to Ned.</p>

<p>Ned was all alert. Jerry, with his eyes straining
to catch the slightest movement of the underbrush,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
peered through the darkness. Something
white attracted him.</p>

<p>“Now!” he whispered to Ned, and the light,
that had been burning low, was suddenly turned on
at full power.</p>

<p>In its glare the two boys saw again the white
haired hermit stealing along the edge of the water,
the big bag on his back.</p>

<p>“Call the others!” whispered Jerry to Ned.
“I’ll keep watch!”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>Ned softly went back to the shack where he
awakened the professor and Bob. They were out
in an instant, and made ready to go quietly down
as close as they could to where the hermit was,
while Jerry showed the way by the searchlight.
But again they were doomed to disappointment,
for, no sooner had Jerry turned the light so that it
shown full on the old man, than he jumped as
though struck by lightning and made a dive for
the woods, into the black depths of which he disappeared.</p>

<p>“I guess that’s the last we’ll see of him,” said
Ned.</p>

<p>“He dropped his bag,” cried Bob. “Let’s get
that and see what’s in it.”</p>

<p>At this the professor and Ned ran down to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
edge of the water, and soon returned with the
sack the old man had carried on his back.</p>

<p>“Open it and let’s see if there are any murdered
persons in it,” said Jerry, with an uneasy
laugh.</p>

<p>Ned untied the string, and, not without some
misgivings, peered inside.</p>

<p>“Well I never,” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Fish! Nothing but fish!” replied Ned.
“Fine ones at that. I guess all we have done is
to have scared the poor old man away from his
fishing grounds.”</p>

<p>“Certainly there is nothing suspicious in having
a bag of fish,” put in the professor. “I wonder
if that strange woman could have been telling the
truth.”</p>

<p>“We’ll know better if she keeps her word and
comes to take us to the hermit’s den,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>There seemed nothing more to do that night, so
they all went to bed, not being disturbed until
morning. They were awakened by the sun peeping
in through the chinks in the shack, and they
got up to find a fine day had succeeded the rainy
one.</p>

<p>The beams of Old Sol were bright and warm,
and the first thing the travelers did was to go down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
and have a dip in the lake. Then breakfast was
served, and when it was over Jerry and Ned
started to overhaul the machine.</p>

<p>“For,” said Jerry, “we may want to leave at
any time, and the car is in none too good condition
since we plowed up the side of the mountain.”</p>

<p>Several minor repairs were made and the auto
was run down to the main road, where it stood in
readiness for a quick start. It was some time
after dinner before all this was done, and along
about three o’clock the four travelers stretched out
under the trees and took a well earned rest.</p>

<p>“Now if that strange woman would&mdash;” began
Ned.</p>

<p>“Hush!” cautioned the professor, “some one
is coming.”</p>

<p>Hardly had he ceased speaking before the bushes
opened and there appeared the figure of the queer
woman, with her long hair hanging loose down her
back.</p>

<p>“Hush!” she whispered, placing her finger on
her lips. “I have come to keep my promise. The
hermit has gone over the mountain. Come, and
I will take you to his hut, and you can see where he
has murdered travelers.”</p>

<p>The boys hardly knew whether to obey or not,
but a nod from Professor Snodgrass, to whom they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
looked, indicated they were to do as the woman
wanted. So they arose and prepared to follow
her. The professor brought up the rear.</p>

<p>Through the woods their strange guide went,
for several miles. At length she reached a thick
part of the woods.</p>

<p>“It is very close now,” she said. “Wait until
I take a look.”</p>

<p>The travelers halted, while the woman crept
softly forward. She peered through the brush
into a sort of clearing, and apparently seeing that
everything was safe, she motioned for the others
to advance.</p>

<p>They did so, and, a moment later emerged from
the woods into a place where many trees had been
cut down. In the centre of this space was a small
log cabin, and toward it the woman pointed.</p>

<p>“There is his hut,” she said. “Come on, I
will lead the way.”</p>

<p>She advanced with great caution, as though she
feared to disturb some one. Closer and closer to
the door she went, the others close behind her.</p>

<p>“He never locks it, so we can go right in,” she
said.</p>

<p>By this time she was near enough to grasp the
latch. She raised it, and was about to enter, when
the door suddenly swung back, and the old hermit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
himself, stepping out, stood before the astonished
travelers.</p>

<p>“There he is! There he is! There is the
murderer!” cried the woman, pointing her finger
at the hermit.</p>

<p>The old man did not appear greatly surprised.
He looked from the woman to the boys and the
professor, and remarked:</p>

<p>“To what am I indebted for the honor of this
visit?”</p>

<p>“I we,&mdash;er&mdash;that is&mdash;we&mdash;er&mdash;I&mdash;” began
the professor, finding it was hard to tell the
truth.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s poor old Kate,” went on the hermit.
“She has probably been telling you some strange
stories. Will you not come into my cabin?”</p>

<p>“Don’t go into the murderer’s hut!” cried the
woman, as she turned and fled back through the
underbrush, leaving the travelers in a somewhat
queer situation.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a><br />
<small>A REVELATION</small></h2>


<p>The professor did not know what to do. He
and the boys expected to find the hut deserted,
but, through some cause, the woman had evidently
made a mistake as to the absence of the hermit.
Nor did Mr. Snodgrass care to accept the invitation
of the old man and enter the hut, not knowing
what he might find there.</p>

<p>“You must not mind what Kate says,” the hermit
went on, seeing that his unexpected visitors
hesitated. “She means well, but she exaggerates
a little sometimes.”</p>

<p>The professor thought that a rather cool manner
in which to reply to accusation of murder, but,
he reflected, if the hermit was as bad as the woman
made him out to be, he would naturally, be rather
a bold sort of person.</p>

<p>The boys, too, were somewhat embarrassed by
their position. To come suddenly upon a man you
expect to bind and hand over to the authorities as
a criminal of the worst kind and then to find him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
calmly inviting you into his house, is something
out of the ordinary. How much longer the travelers
might have stood outside the hut, after the
invitation to enter had been given, will always be a
cause for speculation, because, the next instant
something happened.</p>

<p>The professor, who had been glancing from the
aged hermit to the hut, and then back to the old
man, suddenly uttered an exclamation, and made a
dive for the door.</p>

<p>“There he goes!” cried the scientist. “There
is the one I’ve been looking for for nearly a
month!” and, a second later, he had disappeared
inside the cabin.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? Is some one after you?”
asked the old man hastening in the footsteps of
the scientist, while the boys trailed in behind.
“What do you want?”</p>

<p>“I have it! I have it!” called the professor’s
voice. “It’s a beauty, and a rare one.”</p>

<p>“What does he mean?” asked the hermit,
turning to the boys.</p>

<p>“It’s a pink-winged dragon fly,” cried the professor,
coming back at that point and hearing the
question. He had penetrated to the farther side
of the cabin. “I saw the insect on the cabin
door,” he went on, explaining to the old man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
“Then I saw it go in. I knew it would not stay
long, so the only thing to do was to make a jump
for it, without waiting to explain. I am very glad
I got it, for it’s worth at least seven dollars, and
perhaps more. I must apologize for running into
your cabin in that hasty manner,” the scientist
went on, turning to the old man.</p>

<p>“I guess that was the best way of getting you
into it,” said the hermit with a smile, which, the
boys admitted, was a very pleasant one for a murderer.
“But now you are here, do not be in a
hurry to get out again.”</p>

<p>“If you have no objections I will stay until
I have put away this dragon-fly specimen in a
case,” said the professor, pulling out a small flat
box in which he placed his precious specimens temporarily.</p>

<p>“Let me ask you to supper,” went on the old
man, seeming to the boys to be very eager to
have them remain. “It is so seldom that I have
company that I appreciate it very much. Stay and
have a meal with me.”</p>

<p>The boys and the professor hardly knew what
answer to make. They did not want to stay, yet
did not care to offend by saying no.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid we might inconvenience you,” began
Mr. Snodgrass. “You know what it is when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
company comes unexpectedly, and the larder is
empty.”</p>

<p>“Have no fears on that score,” replied the old
man with a short laugh. “I have plenty for all
of us,” and throwing open a cupboard he showed
it well stocked with many victuals.</p>

<p>As no other excuse offered, the travelers could
do nothing else but agree to stay, though Bob said
afterwards that he kept his hand on his revolver,
in his outside coat pocket, ready to draw it at a
moment’s notice.</p>

<p>So, in a little while, supper was being prepared
by the hermit, who seemed to be quite an expert
cook. As he busied himself about the stove the
boys had time to glance over the cabin. The first
thing that impressed them was that the place was
well planned for defense.</p>

<p>It was built somewhat like the old block houses
the early settlers constructed, with the upper story
projecting over the first, so that the Indians who
besieged the place, could be attacked from above.
Then the lads noted that the sides were pierced
with small loop holes, while on the walls were
several rifles, and belts full of cartridges.</p>

<p>“One might think that you were in an enemy’s
country,” observed Mr. Snodgrass to the hermit,
as he took note of the means of defense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have to be on guard,” responded the hermit,
quickly. “My life is not safe a moment. I
do not know what minute I may be attacked. I
am surrounded by spies on every hand.”</p>

<p>“It is a wonder that you let us in then,” said
Jerry. “How do you know that we will not betray
you?”</p>

<p>“I am too good a reader of human character
as shown in the face to fear anything like that,”
the old man went on. “I can trust you; I know
I can.”</p>

<p>“Who are you in danger from?” asked the
professor, wondering what sort of story the hermit
could tell.</p>

<p>“All kinds of bad men,” was the answer.
“They had me in their power once, but I got
away. I came here because it was a place well
hidden from general observation. I have lived
here several years, and you are the first persons
beside poor Kate, that I have been friendly with
in that time.”</p>

<p>“Then why do you keep ready to repel an
enemy if none has molested you in that period?”
asked Mr. Snodgrass.</p>

<p>“Because there is no telling when the men will
attack me,” replied the old man. “There are
several who would like to get control of me, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
I think I can prevent it. I will never let them
get me into their power again, as long as I have
a shot in the gun.”</p>

<p>Supper was ready by this time, and the travelers,
not very much reassured by the talk of the
strange old hermit sat down to the rude table.
The food, contrary to their expectation, proved
very good.</p>

<p>When the meal was over the hermit began
to question the travelers about their journey and
asked why they came to the lake, which, he said,
was seldom if ever visited. They told him how
they had unexpectedly found the sheet of water.</p>

<p>“That generally is the way in this world,”
said the old man. “If you look for a thing you
never find it, but if you do not, sometimes it
comes to you in the most unexpected manner. I
have sought something for many years, but I have
not found it, and my heart will break if I do not
succeed soon.”</p>

<p>“What is it you are looking for?” asked Ned,
softly, as he saw the hermit was affected.</p>

<p>“I can not tell you now,” was the answer.
“Later I may, and perhaps you can help me in
the quest.”</p>

<p>“We would be glad to,” said the professor.
“But I think we must be going now. It is getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
late and we must get back to the automobile.
Besides, I am afraid we will have trouble finding
our way through the woods.”</p>

<p>“Have no fear,” said the hermit. “I will call
Kate and she will take you back, just as she
brought you here.”</p>

<p>“But I thought she was&mdash;” began Uriah Snodgrass.</p>

<p>“That is only a notion of hers, that I am a
murderer,” spoke the hermit, with a smile. “Kate
pretends to be very much afraid of me, but she
will come to me when I call her. Probably you
are wondering who I am, and why I live out in
these lonely woods. If you care to I will tell you
my story briefly.”</p>

<p>They all said they would be glad to listen, so
the hermit began by saying, for reasons of his own,
that he would not tell his name.</p>

<p>“I do not want it to be known who I am,”
he said. “But, as I said, I was once in the power
of a number of bad men. I used to be a prospector,
and made considerable at it, until trouble
came. Then I came to this lonesome place. I
had heard the legend of Lost Lake, and the gold
supposed to be on its shores, but I never expected
to find this body of water. However, I did come
across it, though I never have found any gold. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
have been here ever since, and that is about three
years. I manage to hunt and fish, and so get
enough to live on. Occasionally I go to the nearest
village, and sell a few articles I make out of
wood, and so get a little money.”</p>

<p>“I should think you would be very lonesome at
times,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“I am glad to be alone when I think of all
I suffered from those men,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Would you mind telling us about the
woman?” asked Mr. Snodgrass. “She seems a
queer creature.”</p>

<p>“She is,” answered the hermit. “She is harmless
enough, except when aroused, and her great
trouble is in thinking that I am a murderer.”</p>

<p>“What makes her think such a thing?” asked
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Because she is slightly crazy,” said the hermit.
“She was in these woods when I came here, and,
in time we grew to be good friends. It seems that
years ago her whole family was killed by the Indians,
she alone escaping. It turned her brain,
and ever since then, she imagines that nearly all
men are murderers. I wonder she has not accused
you of the crime,” and the hermit smiled
a little.</p>

<p>“She certainly acted queer,” admitted the professor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
“but I thought it was because she took
you to be&mdash;er&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t mind having you refer to it,”
put in the old man. “She often accuses me of
the crime to my face. I humor her, and admit
sometimes that I am a desperate criminal, and
that I am going to give myself up to the authorities.
It sort of calms her down.”</p>

<p>“What did you mean by saying that she would
come whenever you called her?” asked Jerry.
“Is she near by?”</p>

<p>“She stays in a little cabin I built for her, not
far off,” replied the hermit. “When I want her
to go on an errand for me, for she is very swift
and reliable, I merely blow this horn,” and he
showed a big conch hanging on the wall. “I will
call her to show you the way back to your camp
when you are ready.”</p>

<p>The professor and the boys thought it was about
time to leave. They promised the hermit they
would come and see him again, and then the old
man, taking down the horn, unbarred the door,
and, stepping out blew three shrill blasts that
reverberated through the woods. It was just getting
dusk, and the echoes, ringing back from the
distant hills, sounded weird in the gathering darkness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>For a few seconds no answer came, then, from
far off in the woods sounded a faint cry.</p>

<p>“Here she comes,” said the hermit. “She will
take you the shortest way.”</p>

<p>In a little while the crackling of the brush could
be heard, and, a few seconds later Kate appeared.
She did not seem surprised not to find the travelers
all murdered.</p>

<p>“Will you show them the way back to camp?”
asked the old man.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Kate, simply. “Follow me,” she
added, turning to the boys and the professor.</p>

<p>They started off after the strange woman, and,
at that instant the old hermit uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>“Some one is coming!” he cried. “It may be
some of my enemies!”</p>

<p>A moment later he turned and fled into the
dark woods!</p>

<small>SEARCHING FOR THE HERMIT</small></h2>


<p>“Let’s go to his help!” exclaimed Bob.</p>

<p>“Come on!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“You had better not,” said the woman, in a
calm voice. “It is probably only the police after
him for the many murders he has committed, and
we had better not interfere. Besides if you want
me to take you to your camp you had better come,
as I have my house work to do before sunrise.”</p>

<p>She started to lead the way, and, though the
boys felt inclined to follow and see what became
of the hermit, they concluded it would be better to
go back to camp.</p>

<p>Kate seemed to have lost much of her excited
manner as she led them through the woods, over
a scarcely discernible path. Neither the fast
gathering darkness nor the maze of trees seemed to
confuse her. She made better progress than did
the boys or the professor, as they were not familiar
with the ground.</p>

<p>“Well of all the queer adventures we’ve had,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
remarked Ned to Jerry, who had lagged somewhat
in the rear with him, “this is the worst.
Think of going to capture a murderer and then
being led home by an insane woman! I wonder
what will come next?”</p>

<p>The journey to camp took some time, as the
path was hard for the boys and professor to follow,
and several times Kate had to wait for them
to catch up to her. At last, however, she brought
them out near the little open place where the auto
stood, and the boys breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>“Our car is safe, anyhow,” said Jerry. “Now
for some sleep.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t we going to have something to eat
first?” demanded Bob in an aggrieved tone.</p>

<p>The others laughed at Chunky’s sorrowful voice.</p>

<p>“We’ll see,” said Jerry. “Perhaps you would
like a cup of chocolate,” he went on, turning to
Kate.</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” she said. “I must not stay
here. I want to see if they have captured the
murderer, so I will go back,” and, turning suddenly,
she returned over the path they had come,
her footsteps growing fainter and fainter.</p>

<p>“Come on, let’s make the chocolate,” said Bob,
when Kate had gone.</p>

<p>Jerry soon had the beverage in preparation, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
they all enjoyed it. Then they fixed up the beds
in the shack, and soon were slumbering, too tired
even to post a guard, though, as events proved,
there was no need for one.</p>

<p>“Well,” remarked Jerry, after breakfast had
been eaten, “I suppose we may as well push on
for Arizona. No use staying here since the mystery
is solved.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it is solved,” spoke Professor
Snodgrass, suddenly. “I’m not altogether satisfied
about that hermit.”</p>

<p>“You don’t think he’s a murderer, do you?”
asked Ned.</p>

<p>“No, but there is something odd about him.
I can not get over the feeling that I have met
him before, or some relative of his. Yet I can
not recall it clearly. He has certain queer little
actions that remind me of some one. I would like
to see him again.”</p>

<p>“If you want to, I think I could find our
way back to the cabin in the day time,” spoke
Ned.</p>

<p>“I took pretty good notice of the trail when we
went over.”</p>

<p>“I wish you could,” said the professor, eagerly.
“I want to have a talk with that old man. Besides,
I think I can get some more specimens at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
his hut. I saw a fine lizard around the door step
in the afternoon.”</p>

<p>So it was decided they would pay another visit
to the hermit’s cabin. Accordingly they started
off after dinner, and, led by Ned, followed the
trail. They went astray several times, and had
to search about for the path, but finally they came
to the place where Kate had halted them the day
before to go forward and peer at the hut.</p>

<p>“Shall we go right on now?” asked Ned, pausing
to see what the rest wanted to do. “The
cabin is just ahead.”</p>

<p>“Go on,” said Mr. Snodgrass.</p>

<p>They came out into the little glade, in which
the cabin stood. As they emerged from the woods
they saw Kate standing in front of the hut, crying.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” asked the professor.</p>

<p>“They have taken the poor old man away and
killed him!” sobbed the woman.</p>

<p>“It’s another of her imaginations,” said Ned,
softly. “Probably the hermit is inside.”</p>

<p>But when they looked he was not to be seen,
and his bed showed that it had not been slept in
that night.</p>

<p>“Will you help me hunt for him?” asked Kate.</p>

<p>“Certainly we will,” answered the professor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then follow me!” exclaimed the woman,
striding off into the woods.</p>

<p>She led the way, explaining in disjointed sentences,
yet so that she could be understood, that
the old man frequently imagined some one was
after him. At such times he would go to one or
another of his hiding places, of which he had a
number in the different parts of the woods.</p>

<p>But this time he was not to be found easily.
Place after place, including caves and deep ravines,
were visited by the searchers, but there was no
sign of the hermit.</p>

<p>“I am sure he has been killed,” said Kate in a
sorrowful tone. “And he was the kindest man
that ever lived.”</p>

<p>“I thought you said he was a murderer,”
spoke the professor, wondering in what strange
channels the woman’s mind ran.</p>

<p>“So he is!” exclaimed Kate, “but he is a good
murderer, and not one of the bad kind.”</p>

<p>“Poor woman,” sighed Mr. Snodgrass. “Her
mind is hopelessly gone.”</p>

<p>Kate started off in a different direction, and the
boys and the professor followed her. She went
at a rapid pace, and soon the travelers were aware
that they were going up hill. The trail became
more steep as they advanced, until they were panting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
from their exertions. Yet the crazy woman
did not seem to become exhausted by the hard pace
in the least.</p>

<p>“There is the hill!” she exclaimed at last, pointing
upward, and the boys saw ahead of them a
big half round mound, at the very summit of which
was an immense tree.</p>

<p>“He sometimes stays in that tree,” spoke Kate,
as they neared the big forest giant.</p>

<p>“In the tree? I presume you mean he has a
sort of platform built among the branches,” said
the professor. “A number of Indian tribes live
that way.”</p>

<p>“He lives right inside the tree what little time
he does live up here,” replied Kate. “The trunk
is hollow, and he crawls into it, and hides until
all danger is past. We will soon see if he is
there.”</p>

<p>An examination of the hollow trunk, however,
showed that the hermit was not within, nor did
the place disclose any signs of his having been
there recently. Kate showed the despair she felt
and the professor and the boys could not help
feeling disappointed. For a while they stood beneath
the spreading branches, wondering what
would be best to do.</p>

<p>All at once the professor, who had been intently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
gazing up into the leafy branches, gave utterance
to an exclamation.</p>

<p>“There it is!” he cried. “A regular beauty!
I must secure that if I never get another. Keep
quiet, every one.”</p>

<p>“It’s another specimen,” said Jerry. “Can’t
you forget them for once, professor?”</p>

<p>“This seems to be a sloth or an ant-bear,” replied
the scientist, as he made preparations to
climb the tree. “It has long white whiskers, a
black body and no tail. Wait until I crawl up
and get it.”</p>

<p>“Never mind coming up, I’m coming down,”
spoke a voice, seeming to come from the animal,
the capture of which the professor was intent upon.</p>

<p>“Bless my soul, it’s a combined sloth and parrot!”
exclaimed the professor. “That is a rare
animal-bird. I must secure it at all hazards.
Help me, boys.”</p>

<p>But there was no need for help, as, the next
instant, two dangling legs descended from the
lower branches of the tree, to be followed, a little
later by a body, and then came a mass of white
hair and whiskers.</p>

<p>“It’s the old hermit!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes! It’s him! it’s him!” cried Kate. “He
is safe! We have found him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>“Be quiet!” cautioned the old man, when he
had reached the ground. “There may be spies
all around, though I think I have escaped them
for the time being.”</p>

<p>“How did you get here?” asked Kate.</p>

<p>“I ran as soon as I heard the noise of men
coming after me,” replied the aged man. “But
I did not dare get into the hollow trunk, for fear
of being seen. So I just crawled up into the
branches, and there I’d be yet if the professor had
not mistaken me for a specimen.”</p>

<p>“You can come down in safety,” said Mr. Snodgrass,
“as there seems to be no one in the neighborhood
but ourselves.”</p>

<p>“That’s good,” was the rejoinder, “but there
is no telling when some one may come. I think
I will go back to my own cabin.”</p>

<p>The hermit started off with Kate, the others
following. He had not proceeded far when he
uttered an exclamation:</p>

<p>“There is one of them!”</p>

<p>At the same instant a roughly dressed man appeared
in the narrow path, as if by magic. At
sight of him the hermit turned and fled back into
the woods.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</a><br />
<small>THE HERMIT’S IDENTITY</small></h2>


<p>“Catch him! I want him! Bring him
back!” exclaimed the stranger as he saw the hermit
disappearing into the depths of the forest.</p>

<p>“What do you want of him?” asked the professor,
not liking the man’s looks.</p>

<p>“What’s that your business?” inquired the
stranger. “Trot along now, and don’t bother
me.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do nothing of the kind,” retorted Mr.
Snodgrass. “That old man is a friend of ours,
and we’ll see that no harm comes to him.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m going to catch him,” replied the
rough looking man, “so stand aside.”</p>

<p>He made as if to go in pursuit of the hermit,
but Kate, with flashing eyes and defiant gestures,
stood in front of the stranger.</p>

<p>“You let him alone!” she exclaimed. “If you
go after him I’ll scratch your eyes out!”</p>

<p>And she looked fierce and strong enough to put
her threat into execution as she stood her ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mind,” she went on, “don’t you dare to stir
a step after him!”</p>

<p>“So that’s the way the land lays, eh?” sneered
the fellow. “Well, we’ll see about that.”</p>

<p>Putting his finger to his lips he blew a shrill
whistle. Hardly had the echo died away than
two more men, more roughly dressed, if possible,
than the first man, made their appearance from
behind bushes where they had evidently been hiding.</p>

<p>“I’ve found him,” said the first man to his
companions. “Now these people want to interfere.”</p>

<p>“Knock ’em out of the way,” growled one of
the late comers.</p>

<p>“Look here!” began Jerry who was beginning
to get angry. “If there’s any knocking to be done
I guess we can do our share.”</p>

<p>“When did you leave home?” asked the first
man, with a sneer. “Look out, young tenderfoot,
how you mix up in this matter.”</p>

<p>“What right have you to follow this old man?”
asked the professor, for he began to believe the
strangers to be some of the enemies of which the
hermit had been fearful.</p>

<p>“That’s none of your affair,” was the answer.
“We want that man and we’re going to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
him. He got away from us once, and we’re going
to take care it does not happen again. Come
on, boys. Let’s trail after the old chap. He
can’t have gone very far.”</p>

<p>The three turned and were about to take after
the hermit when Kate, who had stepped aside,
made a sudden spring, and confronted the leader
of the three men.</p>

<p>“Don’t you dare go after that poor old man!”
she cried. “There! Take that!”</p>

<p>And before the man could raise his hand in defense
Kate gave him a forceful push. It was followed
by a curious happening.</p>

<p>The three men were standing on the very edge
of the knoll, upon the summit of which was the
tree where the hermit had been hiding. So steep
was the descent that when Kate shoved the man
he toppled over backward. Right behind him
were the other two men, and falling against them,
their leader bowled them down like the remaining
pins in a game of skittles. All three of them
went slipping, sprawling, tumbling head over heels
down the steep slope, vainly trying to dig their
hands into the earth and so save themselves.</p>

<p>“There!” exclaimed the woman, as she saw
the men roll down. “I guess they will not defy
me again in a hurry!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t believe they will,” observed the professor
drily.</p>

<p>In fact the men seemed to have had enough of
Kate for, having rolled to the bottom of the hill,
where they arrived somewhat the worse for wear,
they got up, but made no attempt to return. Instead
they shuffled off through the woods, contenting
themselves with shaking their fists at the party
on top of the hill.</p>

<p>“What had we better do now?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Go back to our camp,” spoke Jerry.</p>

<p>“I think perhaps we had,” counseled the professor.
“I thought the poor old hermit was
merely wandering in his mind when he talked
about men being after him, but, it seems he was
right. Now that we have had an encounter with
these men, and incurred their hate, it would be
best if we did not leave our automobile unguarded.
There is no telling what will happen in the next
few hours.”</p>

<p>“What can we do to save the hermit?” asked
Bob.</p>

<p>“Nothing right away, I fear,” replied Mr.
Snodgrass. “We could not find him in the night,
for it will soon be dark, and I think he can look
after himself better than we can, for the present.”</p>

<p>“I think so too,” put in Kate, who seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
have calmed down after her attack on the men.
“We will go back to your camp, and take up the
search to-morrow.”</p>

<p>It was getting dusk now, and the travelers made
the best speed they could, following Kate’s guidance,
back to their shack near the lake. They
found the camp undisturbed and soon were preparing
a supper, which the woman shared. Then
she bade them good night, and promised to come
in the morning.</p>

<p>“I guess we had better post a guard to-night,”
said Jerry, as he and the others were thinking of
turning in. “There may be a lot of those men
after the hermit, and they will not feel any too
friendly toward us for what we have done. What
do you say, Professor?”</p>

<p>Uriah Snodgrass thought the scheme a good one,
and, lots having been drawn, the first watch fell
to Ned. He got out his rifle, and, having provided
a quantity of wood for the fire, and making
the search-light ready so it could be set going
quickly, he prepared to spend part of the night
on guard.</p>

<p>It was rather lonesome, especially as the others
soon fell asleep, as was evidenced by their heavy
breathing and an occasional snore. But Ned knew
that perhaps the lives of his comrades might depend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
on his vigilance, so he fought against the
feeling of dread, as well as the inclination to
sleep, for he was very tired. As the night wore
on a stronger feeling of dread took possession of
the lad. He started at every sound, and the bark
of a fox, the howl of a distant wolf, and even the
hooting of an owl was enough to make him jump.</p>

<p>He was very glad, therefore, when his trick
was up and Jerry took his place.</p>

<p>“Did you see or hear anything?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Nary a thing except the wild animals,” replied
Ned. “There’s a regular menagerie around
here, by the sound in the woods.”</p>

<p>For several hours Jerry remained on guard.
He was wide awake, for the sleep earlier in the
evening had rested him considerably. Part of the
time he sat on a log near the fire, and again, he
would get up and pace back and forth looking
around anxiously.</p>

<p>Jerry replenished the fire and then, feeling somewhat
chilly, began to walk rapidly up and down,
pacing about ten feet in either direction from the
blaze. Once, when he had gone a little further,
and stood near a big elm tree he fancied he heard
a noise among the branches. Glancing up he was
startled by hearing some one utter:</p>

<p>“Hist! Hist!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who’s&mdash;who’s there?” faltered Jerry, for he
was taken by surprise.</p>

<p>“Sh! Not so loud! Have they gone?” asked
a voice.</p>

<p>“Who?” asked the lad, wondering who was
speaking.</p>

<p>“The men who were after me?” was the reply,
and then Jerry recognized the hermit’s voice.</p>

<p>“Yes, they have gone. Come down, you are
safe now,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>There was a scrambling among the branches
and soon the white-haired old man stood on the
ground beside the boy. His clothing was torn,
and his beard was matted with briers and brambles.
His face and hands were cut, and he bore the
appearance of having raced through the thick underbrush.</p>

<p>“I had a hard time escaping them,” said the
hermit. “Have you any water? I have not had
a drink in several hours, and my throat is parched.”</p>

<p>Jerry ran to the water pail to get the hermit a
drink. The noise he made aroused the others.</p>

<p>“What is it? Are they attacking us?” asked
Mr. Snodgrass.</p>

<p>“No, the hermit has come back,” replied Jerry.
“He was hiding up in a tree.”</p>

<p>The professor hurried out of the shack, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
joined the old man, who seemed very glad to get
back among his new friends. He said he had
been wandering around ever since he ran away
when the stranger appeared, and, at last, had determined
to try and find the boys’ camp.</p>

<p>“Now you are here we will take good care of
you, Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Mr.&mdash;” stammered the professor,
forgetting that the hermit had refused to disclose
his identity. The old man noticed the hesitating
tones.</p>

<p>“There is no reason why I should keep my
name a secret from you any longer,” he said.
“You probably never heard of me, and never will
again. I only desire to remain hidden from my
enemies, and I think you are my friends.”</p>

<p>“What is your name?” asked the professor.</p>

<p>“Jackson Bell,” was the reply. “I am an old
gold miner.”</p>

<p>“Jackson Bell,” repeated Jerry, wondering if
he had heard aright.</p>

<p>“Jackson Bell,” repeated the professor.
“Where have I heard that name before?”</p>

<p>“Why you must be Tommy Bell’s father,” exclaimed
Ned.</p>

<p>“What’s that!” fairly shouted the hermit.
“Do you know Tommy Bell? Have you seen my
dear son? Tell me quickly! Do not keep a poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
old man in suspense,” and he seemed greatly agitated.</p>

<p>“I thought I had seen some relative of his
somewhere,” said the professor.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV</a><br />
<small>ATTACKED BY THE ENEMY</small></h2>


<p>“Are you sure the boy we have in mind is
your son?” asked Mr. Snodgrass. “We do not
want to raise false hopes. Perhaps you may be
mistaken.”</p>

<p>“Something tells me I can not be mistaken,”
exclaimed the hermit. “Tommy Bell is not a
common name. Besides, I can describe my son,
and then you will know whether he is the one you
know,” and he rapidly gave a short description
of Tommy.</p>

<p>“That’s him all right,” said Jerry, and the
others agreed that the lad they had rescued from
the hands of the rough men was, indeed, the son
of the hermit.</p>

<p>“And I thought him dead,” said the old man.
“After I had been abused by the wicked gang
that got me in their control I lost sight of poor
Tommy. As soon as I could I made a search for
him, but it was of no use.”</p>

<p>“Tommy thought you had wandered away from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
him,” said Ned. “He told us his story after we
had rescued him.”</p>

<p>“Then you saved his life, just as you have
mine,” broke in Mr. Bell. “I have much to
thank you for. But first I must find my son.
Where did you leave him?”</p>

<p>“At a place called Las Cruces,” replied the professor.
Thereupon he told briefly how they had
taken Tommy from the hands of the lawless gang
and left him with a friend.</p>

<p>“I must go to him at once,” exclaimed the old
man. “I can hardly wait to start. To think
that the boy I thought was dead is alive! And
I suppose he thinks I am dead also,” Mr. Bell
went on.</p>

<p>“He was going to search for you,” replied Bob,
“but he did not know where to start. We can
send him word now.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take him word myself!” cried Mr. Bell.
“I’ll start as soon as it is daylight.”</p>

<p>“Then you had better get some rest and sleep
now,” observed Mr. Snodgrass. “Come into the
shack, and we will make you some hot coffee.”</p>

<p>The hermit begged them to go to no trouble on
his account, but they insisted, and soon the coffee
was boiling on the coals of the camp fire.</p>

<p>“I’m too excited to sleep,” remarked Mr. Bell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
as he went inside the rough shelter to lie down.
And so it would seem, for, every few minutes he
would rouse up from his position, and ask some
particular about his son. He appeared scarcely
able to believe the good news. At length, however,
he grew weary, and along toward morning
fell into a doze.</p>

<p>The others were so tired and sleepy from being
awake the night before that they slumbered late,
and the sun was quite high when Jerry roused
himself, and sat up, wondering what day it was.</p>

<p>He got up, took a plunge in the lake, and came
back to start breakfast, finding that, in the meanwhile,
the others in the camp, including Mr. Bell,
had arisen.</p>

<p>“Now to start and find my son,” cried the
hermit.</p>

<p>“You had better have something to eat first,”
suggested Mr. Snodgrass. “Then perhaps we
can think of some plan to aid you.”</p>

<p>Though impatient to be gone the old man consented
to remain to breakfast. He did not eat
much, however, and seemed ready any minute to
start on the long search for Tommy.</p>

<p>“How would it be if we took you to the nearest
town in our automobile,” suggested the professor,
when the meal was over. “From there you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
can get conveyances and reach Las Cruces in a
short time. If you need any money&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Thank you, I think I have enough for the
present,” interrupted Mr. Bell. “I do not need
much. When I find Tommy I will bring him
back with me, and we will be together once more.
It seems too good to be true!”</p>

<p>“What will become of Kate in the meanwhile?”
asked Mr. Snodgrass. “Though she has
queer ideas concerning you I think she is your
friend. Will she be able to live in these woods
all alone?”</p>

<p>“Kate is able to take care of herself,” was the
reply. “She was in these woods before I came
and she may be here after I am gone. But I will
tell her where I am going, and that I expect to
return.”</p>

<p>A trip was made to the hermit’s hut, and, after
several blasts had been blown on the conch horn,
Kate appeared. She was overjoyed to see the
aged man again, and was told of the latest developments.</p>

<p>“You had better hurry up then, and get away
from these woods,” said the woman.</p>

<p>“Why so?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Because there are a number of strange men
lurking about,” was the answer. “I think they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
are after this good old man. So be on your
guard.”</p>

<p>“It is the same crowd,” said Mr. Bell.
“They hate to give me up.”</p>

<p>“What do they want of you?” asked Jerry.
“You said you might tell us the secret some day,
adding that perhaps we could help you. Maybe
we can help you now.”</p>

<p>“You can help me, and you have helped me,”
said Mr. Bell. “I can tell you the rest of my
story now. As I said I have long been in quest
of some one. That some one is my son Tommy.
I did not want to tell you of him before, as I was
afraid the news would get out. Nor did I tell
you why the gang wanted me in their power. It
is because I hold the final title to a piece of valuable
property, and they can not get possession of
it until I sign off, which I refused to do!”</p>

<p>“Why so?” asked Mr. Snodgrass.</p>

<p>“Because I understand the property is now
claimed by persons who, if not in the eyes of the
law, are, still the rightful owners. If I should
sign my rights away to the gang they would take
the property away from the innocent holders now.
So I refused to sign, and they have ruined me for
it.”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said the professor, cheerfully.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
“We will get you out of their power, never fear.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if the gang that had Tommy is not
the same one that had Mr. Bell in their power,”
suggested Bob. “He told us about men wanting
him to sign papers that would give them control
of some land.”</p>

<p>“They must be the same,” commented Mr.
Bell. “I will be on my guard now. Neither
Tommy nor I will sign a single document. But
now I must start.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Ned.</p>

<p>There was no further cause for delay, so Jerry
got the automobile ready, and, the various belongings
having been stowed away, the engine was
started, after a somewhat longer rest than usual,
and, puffing away in a manner that awoke all the
echoes of the forest, the car started toward the
village at the foot of the slope. From there, it
was arranged Mr. Bell would go forward to Las
Cruces by stage coach, or whatever other means of
travel presented themselves.</p>

<p>Once fairly on the road the spirits of all in the
party rose. It was a fine day, and the fresh mountain
air, crisp and cool, put new life into their
veins.</p>

<p>They were bowling along the road at a good
clip with Jerry at the wheel, when, suddenly in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
the air above their heads, there sounded a shrill
buzz.</p>

<p>“That’s a new kind of a bumble bee,” cried
Uriah Snodgrass. “I must have it for my collection.”</p>

<p>“I guess you wouldn’t want many of that kind,”
said Mr. Bell, quietly.</p>

<p>“Why not? I like all kinds.”</p>

<p>“That was a lead one,” went on the old man.</p>

<p>“You mean a bullet?” asked Bob. “Is some
one firing at us?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid so,” answered the hermit.</p>

<p>Then came a distant report, followed by the
peculiar buzzing sound.</p>

<p>“Speed her up!” cried Bob to Jerry. “Let’s
get out of this danger zone. It’s too much like
being on the firing line to suit me.”</p>

<p>The auto, all this while was speeding along,
and, soon, the shooters, whoever they were, had
been left far in the rear. The sound of the bullets
was no longer heard.</p>

<p>“The reason they are doing it,” answered Mr.
Bell, “is that they want to get me alive. If I was
to be killed their last chance of getting me to sign
the papers would be gone.”</p>

<p>“But there is your son, Tommy,” said Jerry.
“He told us they wanted him to sign. If you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
were dead, he would be your heir, and his signature
would be legal when he became of age. Perhaps
the men could make use of it even before
then.”</p>

<p>“I see! I see!” exclaimed Mr. Bell. “It is
important then that I live so I can beat them at
their own game.”</p>

<p>“Unless you don’t care about living on your
own account or that of your son’s,” said the professor,
grimly.</p>

<p>They kept on steady after this and at last
reached the bottom of the mountain slope.</p>

<p>“Now for the village,” exclaimed Mr. Bell.
“I shall soon see my boy!”</p>

<p>Faster and faster went the auto. The traveling
was good, and Jerry speeded the car to the last
notch. About six o’clock they rolled into town, to
the surprise of many of the inhabitants, who had
never seen one of the puffing, snorting things,
though they had read of them.</p>

<p>A knot of curious persons gathered around the
machine as Jerry brought it to a stop in front of
the post-office. Several boys began to inspect
every part. The travelers were about to alight
when a shrill voice cried out.</p>

<p>“Hey, Jerry! And Bob! And Ned! Hey
there! Oh, how glad I am to see you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>For a moment the Motor Boys did not recognize
the voice. Then Ned saw a lad trying to
break through the crowd.</p>

<p>“It’s Tommy! It’s Tommy Bell!” exclaimed
Ned. “Hey, Tommy! You can’t guess who we
have with us!”</p>

<p>“Tommy Bell! Did you say Tommy Bell!”
exclaimed the hermit. “Where is he? Let me
see him!”</p>

<p>But Tommy had heard his parent’s voice, and
<a href="#image03">the next instant the boy had made a flying leap into
the car</a>, and was clasped in his father’s arms.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI</a><br />
<small>ON THE ROAD AGAIN</small></h2>


<p>“Where in the world did you come from?”
asked Jerry of Tommy.</p>

<p>“How did you get here?” inquired Ned.</p>

<p>“How did you know where to find us?” Bob
wanted to know.</p>

<p>But to all these questions Tommy turned a deaf
ear. He was so overjoyed at seeing his father,
and the hermit was so excited at seeing his son once
more, that neither had eyes nor ears for anything
or any one except the other.</p>

<p>The crowd looked on curiously, the interest divided
between the automobile and the meeting between
father and son. Finally, when Mr. Bell
and Tommy had, temporarily, exhausted the theme
of telling each other how glad they were at being
united, the boys had a chance to get a word in
edgeways, and Tommy answered a few of their
questions.</p>

<p>He told them that he had remained for several
days with his friend in Las Cruces, and how a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
traveling miner had, in a general conversation,
mentioned the lake and told of the queer hermit
that lived on the shores.</p>

<p>Something in the description of this odd character
impressed Tommy with the belief that the
hermit might be his father, who had taken that
method to escape the gang which wanted him to
sign away his rights. Accordingly, the boy had
started from Las Cruces and made his way to
Deighton, the town where Mr. Bell expected to
start in search of his son.</p>

<p>“I got here this morning,” said Tommy, “and
I found a little work to do to earn some money.
I was going to start up the mountain to-morrow
and try and find the lake.”</p>

<p>“Now you don’t have to,” said Mr. Bell.
“Well, it certainly is a queer world.”</p>

<p>The travelers spent the night at the Deighton
hotel, and, in the morning, after a good breakfast,
assembled to talk over their plans for the future.</p>

<p>“Do you intend to go back to Lost Lake, Mr.
Bell?” asked the professor. “If you do, you
and your son can ride that far in the automobile,
since we are going back in that direction.”</p>

<p>“Where are you going after you leave Lost
Lake?” asked Mr. Bell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>“To Arizona,” answered Jerry. “We have a
mine there, and we must go to see how things are
getting on.”</p>

<p>“That’s rather odd,” commented the hermit.
“I have an interest in some mining property in
Arizona, though I don’t suppose it is anywhere
near yours. But I have made up my mind not to
go back to Lost Lake, except to bring away a few
things that I left in the cabin. I would also like
to provide for poor Kate. After that I think
Tommy and I will go to Arizona and try our fortunes
over again.”</p>

<p>“Then why not go with us?” spoke Jerry.
“We have plenty of room in the machine, and
we’d be glad of your company.”</p>

<p>“I would like to very much,” said Mr. Bell,
“if I thought I would not bother you.”</p>

<p>He was assured that he would be very welcome,
and then he consented to go. A new stock of provisions
was purchased, together with some ammunition
and some other supplies for the auto.
Then, amid the cheers of more than half the populace
of Deighton, the travelers began their journey
toward Lost Lake again.</p>

<p>Mr. Bell had made arrangements with a family
in the town to take charge of Kate whom he promised
to send to them, for he knew he could depend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
on the woman to obey him and make the
journey alone.</p>

<p>Lost Lake was reached on the second day, for
the travelers were delayed by a landslide, and had
to camp out one night. They found the camp and
the hermit’s hut undisturbed.</p>

<p>“I guess none of the gang has been around
lately,” remarked Jerry.</p>

<p>“I hope we have seen the last of them,” put in
Mr. Bell. “They certainly caused enough trouble.”</p>

<p>A few blasts on the horn brought Kate, and the
poor demented woman was overjoyed to see her
friends again. She made much of Tommy, who,
she said, looked enough like his father to be recognized
on the darkest night.</p>

<p>At first the crazy woman objected to being sent
to Deighton, but Mr. Bell knew how to reason
with her, and after some argument, she consented
to go. She started away on the second morning,
and, as the travelers learned later, eventually
reached the family that had consented to care for
her. Under skillful medical treatment Kate partly
recovered her reason, and continued to live in
Deighton for many years.</p>

<p>“Now,” remarked the professor, when they
had seen Kate started off on her journey, “I suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
it is time for us to move. So let’s get started
toward our mine, for I’m sure Nestor must be
quite anxious to see us.”</p>

<p>“Onward it is, then!” exclaimed Ned. “All
aboard, and may we have a safe trip!”</p>

<p>With Ned at the steering wheel the auto was
started off. The way was rather rougher than
any they had yet traveled over, and for some distance
the ascent was steep. But with a new set of
batteries and spark plugs, and with everything on
the car well adjusted, matters went along smoothly,
though no very great speed could be attained.</p>

<p>Mile after mile was covered, the auto mounting
higher and higher amid the mountains. There
were no signs of human habitation, not even a deserted
miner’s hut being passed the first two days
of the trip.</p>

<p>Of course there was no shelter to be had, and
nights were spent in the open. But as the weather
was mild, and as it did not rain, this was considered
more a pleasure than a hardship.</p>

<p>The third day they began to see signs that told
them they were approaching a town. Now and
then cabins and huts would be passed, mostly the
lonely homes of solitary miners, who were prospecting
for gold. Sometimes they would pass
quite good sized camps, and about noon of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
fourth day they were invited to come in and have
a meal, which they were glad to do.</p>

<p>The miners told them the nearest town was
Sleighton, seventy-five miles away, and that it
was the centre of activity for a large area of country
round about.</p>

<p>“And I wouldn’t advise you folks to speed that
there machine of yours when you strike the village,”
said one of the miners.</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Because the marshal is very strict, and he ain’t
got no very great hankerin’ fer choo-choo wagons.”</p>

<p>“We’ll look out,” promised Jerry. “We are
in too much of a hurry to want any delays.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if we’ll hear anything more of that
gang,” said Ned as they rode away from the mining
camp. “It seems queer that they would drop
the thing when they seemed so anxious to capture
Mr. Bell.”</p>

<p>“We’ll hear of them again, and in a way we
won’t like, I’m afraid,” said the former hermit.
“We’ll have to be on the lookout.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII</a><br />
<small>TROUBLE AT THE MINE</small></h2>


<p>Several days’ travel brought the party over the
line into Arizona. They passed through a small
village one noon, and, on inquiring their where-abouts
were told that they were well within the
borders of the state where their gold mine was
located.</p>

<p>It began to rain shortly after this, and their
trip was rather unpleasant, but, well wrapped up
in rubber coats, they managed to keep fairly dry.
As for the auto it did not seem to mind what kind
of weather it was.</p>

<p>They camped that night under a clump of pine
trees which served as a partial shelter, and it was
so wet that no fire could be built. Jerry resorted
to the stove made from one of the search-lights,
and made some hot chocolate that warmed them
all up.</p>

<p>The next day dawned clear, however, and with
a better feeling the travelers took up their journey
again. The way was becoming familiar to them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
and they recognized many landmarks they had
observed in their great race across the continent
to secure the gold mine before Noddy Nixon and
his crowd could win the claim, as told in detail
in “The Motor Boys Overland.”</p>

<p>That night they stayed in the town where the
government assay office was located and to reach
which there had been such an exciting brush between
the two automobiles, the one run by Noddy,
and that run by the Motor Boys. They saw several
men whom they knew slightly, and who appeared
much surprised to see them again.</p>

<p>“Well, well, well, where in the world did you
come from?” asked the proprietor of the hotel,
as the auto drew up in front of his place. He
had been quite friendly with the boys while they
stayed at the mine, and had sold them many supplies.</p>

<p>“We’ve been down to Mexico for a change of
air,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“I suppose it didn’t agree with you, or you
wouldn’t be coming back so soon,” went on the
proprietor.</p>

<p>“Well, we thought our mine needed looking
after,” Jerry remarked.</p>

<p>“Looking after? I should say it did,” the proprietor
continued. “Jim Nestor was here the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
other day and he said if you didn’t come back
pretty soon and do something, there wouldn’t be
any mine.”</p>

<p>“Is that right?” asked Ned, thinking the man
might be trying to scare them for a joke.</p>

<p>“Straight as a string,” was the answer. “It
seems that the title to the place is in doubt.”</p>

<p>“I know, Nestor wrote us about that,” put in
Jerry. “But he is still in possession, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Can’t say,” replied the hotel man. “He was
very anxious the last time I saw him, and that
was a week ago. If I was you I’d look after it
the first thing in the morning.”</p>

<p>“We will,” said Jerry. “I wonder if the government
office is closed.”</p>

<p>“Long ago,” said the proprietor of the inn.
“Why?”</p>

<p>“I was thinking I could go there and find out
what sort of claim there was against our
property,” answered the boy.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to wait until ten o’clock to-morrow
morning,” went on the man. “They’ve got
a new official in charge and he takes more time
off than he puts in. Some one ought to write to
the President about it. There’s lots of kicks
about the way he acts.”</p>

<p>Neither the boys nor the professor did much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
sleeping that night, because of worry over the
mine tangle. They made an early breakfast and
then started for their claim, which they expected
to reach in about two hours unless something unexpected
occurs.</p>

<p>The way was familiar to them, and recalled
many old memories of the exciting times they had
in locating and proving their claim. They pointed
out to Mr. Bell the various landmarks as they
passed them, but the former hermit seemed to
have fallen into a sort of stupor. His eyes had a
vacant stare and he took no interest in what was
being said.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid he’s going to be sick,” said Jerry
to the professor. “He has hardly spoken since
we came into Arizona, and he used to be quite a
talker.”</p>

<p>“I guess it is only the excitement wearing off,”
said Mr. Snodgrass. “He will be all right in
a day or two. He has had a pretty hard life
the last few weeks.”</p>

<p>Tommy was worried about his father, and sat
beside him, holding his hand, now and then looking
up into his face, as if he feared to lose his
parent again.</p>

<p>As they neared the mine Mr. Bell seemed to
become more dazed. Yet he appeared to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
struggling to recall something that he had once
known and forgotten.</p>

<p>Suddenly he stood up in the automobile, as the
car passed a deserted and tumbled down hut and
exclaimed:</p>

<p>“See! There it is! There is the place!”</p>

<p>“What place, father? What do you mean?”
asked Tommy.</p>

<p>But Mr. Bell sat down again, and seemed to
have forgotten that he had spoken. The professor
could note, however, that there was a struggle
going on in the old man’s mind.</p>

<p>“I hope he does not become raving mad, yet
it looks bad for him,” the professor thought to
himself.</p>

<p>“Ten minutes more and we’ll be there!” exclaimed
Jerry, crowding on a little more speed.
“I do hope Nestor is having no trouble.”</p>

<p>They were in the midst of a wild mountainous
country now. On either side of the road were
great bowlders, while a little further back was
scrub timber which extended for a mile or more
before the deeper woods were reached.</p>

<p>They were just rounding the last turn of the
road to swing into the straight stretch that would
take them to the mine when there sounded on the
air the crack of a rifle. An instant later Mr. Bell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
gave a convulsive start and fell over in his seat.</p>

<p>“They’ve killed him! They’ve shot him!”
cried Tommy, while Jerry suddenly brought the
machine to a stop. Glancing across to the left
a small curling cloud of smoke could be seen floating
above a big stone.</p>

<p>“There’s where the shot came from,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“Is he badly hurt?” asked Jerry of Professor
Snodgrass, who was bending over Mr. Bell.</p>

<p>“It is hard to say,” was the answer. “The
bullet struck him on the head, but there is so
much blood I can’t tell how bad the wound is.
Push on to the mine. Perhaps Nestor can help
us.”</p>

<p>Jerry started the machine again. It had attained
a good speed when, from the side of the
road came a hail.</p>

<p>“Motor Boys, ahoy!”</p>

<p>“There’s Nestor!” cried Ned, pointing to a
man who stood in front of a small shanty.
“Hello, Nestor!” he called.</p>

<p>“Hello!” responded the miner, running down
to the road. “Well, I am certainly glad to see
you.”</p>

<p>“Quick, Nestor!” exclaimed Mr. Snodgrass.
“We have a wounded man here, and must get him
to the shanty at the mine as soon as possible.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>“We can’t do it,” replied Nestor.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you get my letter?”</p>

<p>“Only the one saying there might be a possibility
of trouble.”</p>

<p>“Well trouble came all right. I’ve been
driven from the mine, and it’s in possession of a
bad gang. So we can’t take the wounded man
there.”</p>

<p>“What are we to do?” asked Jerry, seeing that
Mr. Bell was bleeding badly.</p>

<p>“Bring him into my cabin,” said Nestor. “I
came here after the gang drove me out. I can
put you up, I guess.”</p>

<p>Jerry ran the car up close to the shanty and
Mr. Bell, who was unconscious, was carried in
and laid as tenderly as possible on the single
bunk of which the place boasted.</p>

<p>“Now some warm water and clean clothes,”
said Mr. Snodgrass. “I must wash the wound
and see how bad it is.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t a bit of hot water,” said Nestor.</p>

<p>“There’s plenty in the radiator of the auto,”
spoke Jerry. “Give me a pail and I’ll soon get
some.”</p>

<p>He soon had a plentiful supply that was almost
boiling, and, cooling it somewhat, the naturalist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
carefully washed the blood from the wounded
man’s head. Then he examined the hurt.</p>

<p>“Will he die?” asked Tommy, as he stood
around, tearfully.</p>

<p>“Not this time,” replied Mr. Snodgrass, cheerfully.
“The bullet appears to have only grazed
the scalp a bit, but it probably gave him a pretty
hard knock. He’ll soon come around right I
guess.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bell was made as comfortable as possible,
and, as there was nothing to do but wait until he
became conscious, he was left in charge of his son.
Tommy was told to call as soon as his father
showed signs of awakening, and then the others
surrounded Nestor, eager to hear about the
mine.</p>

<p>“I guess it’s gone,” said the old prospector.
“As I wrote you, the title seems to have some
flaw in it, and this gang, which came from somewheres
to the southeast, found it out, and served
papers on me. It appears that there is a man
missing who holds the key to the situation, and
who owns the majority of the mine, but he can’t
be found, and so our title is no good.”</p>

<p>The news depressed the spirits of all. They
had been hoping that the trouble was small and
temporary and that Nestor would find a way out.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
Now they stood to lose the mine they had struggled
so hard to get.</p>

<p>“Did you resist their claim?” asked Mr.
Snodgrass.</p>

<p>“You bet I did,” replied Nestor. “I went to
court over it, but the judge said though it was
morally wrong to put me out, yet the others had
the law on their side, and he had to decide against
me.</p>

<p>“I didn’t give up even then, for I barricaded
the place and defied ’em to get me out. But the
sheriff came and said that was no way to do. He
had the law with him, and he said it would be
his duty to shoot me if I resisted. He advised
going to a higher court, and so, rather than have
any bloodshed I gave up, and decided to camp
out here until you came. I’ve been here about
two weeks now.”</p>

<p>“Then the mine’s gone,” remarked Jerry, sorrowfully.</p>

<p>“We can try the courts,” said Nestor, hopefully.</p>

<p>“It would take years to settle the case,” put
in Mr. Snodgrass. “No, I guess you are beaten,
boys.”</p>

<p>“I will not give up yet,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” asked Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m going to town, hire the best lawyer I
can get, and see what he says. There may be a
way out of this yet.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way to talk!” exclaimed Bob.
“I’m with you.”</p>

<p>Jerry lost no time. He hurried to the auto, and
with Bob for company made the run to town in
record time. He was directed to a lawyer’s office,
and, finding the attorney, who was a young chap,
in, paid him a retainer and stated the case briefly.</p>

<p>“I just want to know how we stand, what sort
of a claim there is against our title, and what we
can do to perfect it,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“It’s quite a lot of information to get at in a
hurry,” said the lawyer, “but I’ll do my best.
I’ll be ready for you at four o’clock this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“I’ll call for you then,” went on Jerry, “and
take you back to Nestor’s shanty, where you can
explain the whole thing to us.”</p>

<p>Then the boys, with a feeling of dread that
their mine was gone forever, in spite of all they
could do, went back to where the others were.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII</a><br />
<small>ALL’S WELL THAT ENDS WELL</small></h2>


<p>They found Mr. Bell in much the same condition
as before, though Mr. Snodgrass said the
wounded man’s breathing was a little easier,
which was a good sign.</p>

<p>“And what about the mine?” asked the naturalist.
Jerry told him the lawyer was coming.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it will be of little use,” said the
professor. “Nestor says they had a big lawyer
to represent the gang, and they also have a large
force in charge of the mine, taking out gold.”</p>

<p>“And it’s our gold,” exclaimed Jerry. “Oh,
why didn’t we get back sooner?”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t have done much good,” spoke
Nestor. “I did all I could, but the law was on
their side.”</p>

<p>“Of course, I didn’t mean that you failed,”
Jerry hastened to add, for fear of hurting the
old miner’s feelings. “It’s too bad, that’s all.”</p>

<p>After a somewhat gloomy dinner, which the
professor tried to liven up by telling jokes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
funny stories, Jerry oiled the machine, and, about
two o’clock started back to town for the lawyer.
He found the attorney waiting for him, with several
big law books in a valise.</p>

<p>“Any luck?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Not a great deal,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t tell us until we are all together,”
went on Jerry. “I don’t want to stand it all
alone.”</p>

<p>When, on arrival at Nestor’s cabin, the lawyer
proceeded to tell what he had learned, there were
six very attentive listeners.</p>

<p>The attorney went over the ground carefully,
and told the boys, Nestor and Professor Snodgrass,
much that they had already heard. How,
because of a missing owner who held more than
a half interest in the mine, the title was not good
when the boys preëmpted it. In fact it was still
the property of others, though about to lapse.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand all them legal terms,” put
in Nestor, “but didn’t we make a good claim to
the government for that mine?”</p>

<p>“You did, as far as it went,” replied the lawyer.
“Uncle Sam gave you a title, but did not
guarantee that some one did not have a better
one, which it seems is the case.”</p>

<p>“But that gang hasn’t a good title either, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
if the owner of over half the shares is missing,”
went on Nestor.</p>

<p>“No, but it seems, according to the records,
that they have some sort of an agreement from
this missing man that they are empowered to work
the claim until he comes to demand his share.”</p>

<p>“If that’s the case I’m for going up there and
driving them out with a gun!” exclaimed Nestor.
“They haven’t any more right than we have, and
we can at least make them go shares with us
until this missing man shows up. What’s the matter
with attacking them to-night.”</p>

<p>“If you’re going to resort to lawless means
I’ll have to throw up the case,” said the attorney.
“That is no way to talk.”</p>

<p>“Nestor doesn’t mean it at all,” put in Jerry.
“Of course we will have no battle with that
gang.”</p>

<p>“There are two ways we might proceed,” the
lawyer went on. “There may be more, but they
are the only ones that suggest themselves to me
from what time I was able to give to the case.”</p>

<p>“What would you advise?” asked Mr. Snodgrass.</p>

<p>“You can apply to the courts for an injunction
to prevent the working of the mine until the
missing half-owner shows up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>“But that would bar us as well as them,” put in
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Yes, it would have that effect, if you secured
the injunction, which is doubtful. It would be a
long and costly litigation, I fear.”</p>

<p>“And what is the other plan?”</p>

<p>“You might try to find the missing man, and
buy him out, or make some arrangement with him.
From what I can learn he and the others have
quarreled and are opposed to each other.”</p>

<p>“Where is the missing man?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“That is something on which I can not be of
the least help to you,” was the reply. “There is
nothing to show where he is.”</p>

<p>“Then it would be like looking for a needle
in a haystack to search for him, and as long and
costly as the injunction means,” commented Mr.
Snodgrass.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it would,” was the lawyer’s answer.</p>

<p>“What is the man’s name?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“I have it here,” proceeded the attorney. “It
is Mr. Well, no, that’s not it. Oh yes! Here
it is. Bell, that’s it. Mr. Jackson Bell.”</p>

<p>“What?” fairly shouted the three boys at once.</p>

<p>“What name?” inquired the professor, wondering
if he had heard aright.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>“Jackson Bell,” repeated the lawyer. “Why,
do you know him?”</p>

<p>“Know him?” went on Jerry, jumping up in
his excitement. “Why he is in the next room
this very minute! Well of all the strange pieces
of luck!”</p>

<p>Then they all tried to tell the lawyer at once
the story of the hermit and his son, making such
a jumble that the attorney had to beg them to
stop, while he listened to one at a time. Finally
the tale was related, and the boys and the professor
as well, greatly excited, paused to see what
the lawyer would say.</p>

<p>“Then I don’t see any further trouble to your
getting possession of the mine,” said the attorney.
“If Mr. Bell is on your side, and you make a
joint application to the court or even to the government
agent, I am sure you will be given instant
charge of the claim.”</p>

<p>“There is only one difficulty,” said Mr. Snodgrass.
“Mr. Bell is wounded. His mind was
not strong before the shooting, and it may be altogether
gone when he recovers consciousness. In
that case&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“In that case I’m afraid you are as badly off
as before,” finished the lawyer.</p>

<p>The door to the inner room, where Mr. Bell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
was in the bunk, opened, and Tommy came out,
looking worried.</p>

<p>“Is he worse, Tommy?” asked the professor.</p>

<p>“He’s acting very queer,” replied the boy.
“He is sitting up in bed, and is trying to get something
out from under his shirt. He’s talking something
about a mine.”</p>

<p>“He is probably delirious,” said Mr. Snodgrass.
“We must have a doctor. I’m afraid it
looks bad for us, boys.”</p>

<p>At that instant the form of Mr. Bell, weak and
tottering, showed in the doorway. He seemed
greatly excited.</p>

<p>“There you are!” he cried tearing open his
shirt and throwing a bundle, done up in oiled
silk on the table. “There are the papers.
There are the proofs to the mine. The gang did
not get them after all!”</p>

<p>“Calm yourself,” spoke Mr. Snodgrass, in a
soothing tone that one uses to sick children or
fever patients.</p>

<p>“I’m all right!” exclaimed Mr. Bell. “Don’t
think I’m crazy. I was a little off my head, but
the wound the bullet gave me, and the blood I
lost, accomplished just what was needed. There,
I tell you, are the papers proving my claim to
the mine.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>“What mine?” asked the professor, while the
others waited in anxiety for the answer.</p>

<p>“The mine we were going to,” responded the
old man. “From the description you boys gave
of it I recognize it as the same one I have more
than a half share in. All the way up here I was
trying to recall when I had been here before. I
recognized the places, but my mind would not
serve me. I had suffered so much that I was almost
crazy. Then came the shot, and I did not
know anything more, until I just woke up in that
room, and remembered all about it. Now we
will beat that gang.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” cried Jerry, seizing Ned by the
arms and starting to dance a hornpipe.</p>

<p>“Are you sure you can not be mistaken about the
mine?” asked Mr. Snodgrass, for it seemed hardly
possible that the old hermit, whom they had rescued,
should turn out to be the much-wanted
missing owner.</p>

<p>“There are the papers, you can see for yourself,”
replied Mr. Bell.</p>

<p>The lawyer, at a sign from the professor, made
a careful examination of the documents.</p>

<p>“They seem to be all right,” he said. “I have
no doubt but that you can fully establish your
claim, Mr. Bell.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>“It isn’t my claim, sir.”</p>

<p>“Why I thought you said&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Everything I have or own is the property of
these noble boys and Professor Snodgrass,” went
on the former hermit. “They saved my life, and
that of my son’s. If I gave them a hundred mines
I could not repay them.”</p>

<p>“But we do not want your share,” said Mr.
Snodgrass.</p>

<p>“It don’t make any difference what you want,
you’ve got to take it,” said Mr. Bell, firmly.</p>

<p>“We can settle that part later,” put in the lawyer.
“The thing to do now is to get possession
of the mine. If you wish I will act for you.”</p>

<p>“Of course we want you to,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“Very well. I will take these papers, and go
to court with them. If I am successful, as I have
no doubt I shall be, I will apply to the sheriff to
oust the crowd that is in charge of the mine.
Then you and Mr. Bell can take possession.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way to talk!” fairly yelled Nestor,
who was anxious to get back to the “diggings.”</p>

<p>The lawyer was hurried back to town in the
auto. Nothing could be done that afternoon, as
the court was closed. He promised to be on hand
early in the morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys could hardly sleep that night. Mr.
Bell seemed to have fully recovered, and, beyond
a slight pain where the bullet had hit him, he did
not suffer. It was late when they went to bed, and
somewhat late when they arose.</p>

<p>“I’m going into town and see what’s doing,”
said Jerry after breakfast.</p>

<p>“So am I,” cried Ned and Bob.</p>

<p>“Better not,” went on Jerry. “If I have to
bring back the lawyer, and the sheriff and some of
his deputies to read the riot act to the gang, I’ll
need all the room there is.”</p>

<p>So Jerry went off alone in the car. He did not
find the lawyer in, but the attorney’s clerk said he
was at court.</p>

<p>“I’ll wait until he comes back,” said Jerry, and
he sat down in the office. Two hours later, the
lawyer came in.</p>

<p>“What luck?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“The very best. I have a peremptory order
commanding that crowd to turn the mine over to
your party and Mr. Bell. Come on, we’ll get the
sheriff and finish the thing right up.”</p>

<p>The sheriff was only too glad of a chance for
some activity. He and three deputies, well armed,
got into the car, and Jerry started off. To the boy
the machine never seemed to move so slowly, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
several times one of the deputies threatened to
jump out if the auto did not slacken up a bit.</p>

<p>Arriving at the cabin, Nestor, the two boys, and
Professor Snodgrass were found anxiously waiting.</p>

<p>“Now for the mine!” cried Jerry, as he rapidly
explained the success of the mission.</p>

<p>“Wait till I get my gun,” said Nestor.</p>

<p>“No shooting unless we have to,” warned the
sheriff.</p>

<p>Then they advanced on the mine. An eighth of
a mile away they were halted by a guard. But an
order from the sheriff, and a sight of the command
from the court, made the guard give in, and he was
sent back to the cabin, in custody of one of the
deputies.</p>

<p>Then, without any warning, the party descended
on the others of the gang, who were all gathered in
the main cabin at dinner.</p>

<p>At first it looked as if there was going to be
trouble. Several made an attempt to get their
guns, but Nestor, the sheriff, and his man, had
covered them, and they saw that the game was up.</p>

<p>“I’ll read you this court order,” said the
sheriff.</p>

<p>“You needn’t bother,” spoke the leader, whom
the boys recognized as one of the men who had
held Tommy a captive. Others in the gang were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
recognizable as men who had tried to capture Mr.
Bell at Lost Lake.</p>

<p>“We played a bold game, but we lost,” said the
leader, as he and his companions, gathering up
their baggage, left the cabin, and made their way
toward town. They did not go there, however,&mdash;since
they feared further proceedings,&mdash;and were
never heard of again.</p>

<p>“Hurrah, now we have our mine back again!”
cried Jerry. “I wonder if it is paying?”</p>

<p>“Better than ever, by the looks of this stuff,”
answered Jim Nestor, picking up some newly-mined
ore that lay on ground. “No wonder that
crowd wanted to keep possession of the mine.”</p>

<p>There followed a general jollification. The
boys got up a fine dinner, at which the sheriff, his
men, and the lawyer were guests. An arrangement
was made whereby Mr. Bell should retain a
large interest in the mine, while the other share was
divided between our friends as before. The lawyer
received a generous fee, and the sheriff and his
men were not forgotten.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Jerry, a week later, “we came out
all right, didn’t we? I presume our adventures
are all over now.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be too sure,” put in Bob. “Something
else may turn up soon.” And Bob was right, as
we shall learn in another volume, to be called,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
“The Motor Boys Afloat; Or, The Stirring
Cruise of the <i>Dartaway</i>,” a tale of land and sea.</p>

<p>The days to follow were busy ones for Jim Nestor
and the boys. The mine was started up in better
shape than ever before, new machinery put in,
and extra workmen engaged. Letters were sent to
the boys’ folks, telling of all that had happened.</p>

<p>“I want to say one thing,” said Jerry, one day.
“And that is, that it feels mighty good to be back
in the United States again.”</p>

<p>“Exactly what I say,” returned Ned.</p>

<p>“Right you are,” came from Chunky. He
rubbed his hands together. “And as we are back,
and all is well, why&mdash;er&mdash;let us have some dinner.”</p>

<p>And then, with a merry laugh at the lad who
never wanted to miss a meal, the others followed
Chunky to the table; and here as they sit down to a
well-earned repast, we will take our departure.</p>
